<h2>Writing guidelines</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we receive tons of outreach emails for Guest Post, we decided to create these guidelines to make the whole process easier for both you and us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We accept only <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/characteristics-high-quality-blog-post/300533/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">high-quality articles</a> that comply with our guidelines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Unique content</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your content has to be unique. Not only in terms of “duplicate content” (that goes without saying), <strong>the article should cover something not found on hundreds of other Make Money Online, Blogging and SEO blogs</strong>, or at least look at the familiar topic from a new point of view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We prefer these types of content:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Step-by-step guides</strong>&nbsp;– a how-to post written in a beginner-friendly way</li><li><strong>Case studies</strong>&nbsp;– your own research or analysis based on real data</li><li><strong>Evergreen educational content</strong>&nbsp;– a post explaining some SEO notion with examples and useful tips</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Added value</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know every reader love well-structured, useful and helpful content. <strong>Use real examples, case studies, researched data, charts and graphics whenever possible.</strong> That is what distinguishes a quality post from a “random bunch of text” submission, whose only purpose is to get a quick backlink from us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Proper optimization</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget to do build the post around <strong>the focus keyword</strong> (you can use any SEO plugin) that represents the topic. Do some basic keyword research and <strong>optimize the post accordingly, including the usage of the appropriate headings.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Links</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure to back up your claims by relevant links to valuable resources. Resources should be from high DA PA. If possible, <strong>include at least one internal link to one of our blog posts.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Images</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don’t have to create a featured image for the article, we will create one once we accept your article. However, <strong>we strongly recommend using relevant images in the text – screenshots, illustrations, graphs, etc. Please avoid stock photos</strong> if possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t have resources to create interesting and quality visuals, let us know and we can help you with that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Article length</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although quality is more important for us than quantity, in general, the post should have<strong> at least 1200 words</strong> with focus keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
