<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're studying for the PMI-ACP test, you should definitely pick up a copy of the Agile Practice Guide, which was written by PMI and Agile Alliance. Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP) are just few of the agile approaches covered in this overview. Important concepts, principles, and practices for agile practitioners are also covered.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">PMBOK速 Guide - Sixth Edition</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the Sixth Edition, the PMBOK速 Guide (Project Management Body of Knowledge) has been applicable for the PMI-ACP certification despite its more common association with traditional project management. To fully grasp how agile approaches fit into more conventional project management frameworks, practitioners need to be conversant with the PMBOK速 Guide. The value of implementing agile concepts in a broader project management environment is reinforced by this incorporation, which guarantees that agile projects are in line with company goals and strategic objectives.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Standard for Agile Requirements</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're an agile practitioner interested in earning your PMI-ACP credential, you'll need to consult the PMI's Standard for Agile Requirements. It explores how requirements are gathered, defined, and managed in agile projects. For the agile team to effectively produce solutions that fulfill the needs of the stakeholders, they must have a firm grasp of this standard. Because of its emphasis on the iterative and collaborative nature of requirements management in agile projects, this standard is of particular importance to PMI-ACP candidates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Disciplined Agile Delivery</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To better handle the complexities and problems of enterprise-level projects, the agile community has developed Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD), a process decision framework that extends agile approaches. The DAD framework is explained in detail in the PMI book "Disciplined Agile Delivery: A Practitioner's Guide to Agile Software Delivery in the Enterprise," which instructs professionals on how to modify and expand agile methods for large and complicated projects. PMI-ACP applicants working for companies with enterprise-level agile initiatives must be familiar with DAD.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certified professionals and other PMI members are expected to uphold the organization's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This code establishes the guidelines for ethical and professional behavior in project management, making its study and observance by PMI-ACP candidates essential. Promoting trust, openness, and responsibility inside the team and with stakeholders is the focus of ethical behavior, making it a crucial part of becoming an agile practitioner.</p>
