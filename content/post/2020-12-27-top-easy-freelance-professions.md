<p>In 2021, teleworking and free employment will still be more relevant than ever.&nbsp;2020 has shown how convenient this format of work is, and it is unlikely to ever go out of style.&nbsp;It is better to search for a source of income in areas with the greatest demand: now it is a digital technology niche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the article, we talked about the features of <a href="https://waytoidea.com/ways-to-make-money-online/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">earning money</a> in IT and Digital and collected our top freelance professions for 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Programming</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Average salary of a self-employed programmer in India</strong> :<br><strong>60,000–80,000 rupees.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Programming hides several areas in demand on the market:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Web development.</li><li>Mobile applications.</li><li>Information Security.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Web developers are building websites.&nbsp;Now almost every company has a website - everyone is rapidly integrating their business into the Internet - so the performers are welcomed with open arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellingly, there are not so many really good specialists who can write an adaptive and user-friendly website: a developer with a good portfolio has every chance to withstand the competition and get customers who are ready to pay decently for his services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developers of mobile applications for Android and iOS realize themselves by creating services for these platforms: from simple games for primary school children to web banking with an increased level of security.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding out the top remote professions for freelance programming is&nbsp;information security&nbsp;.&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, in 2020 the&nbsp;level of cybercrime increased by 75.1%&nbsp;compared to the beginning of the year.&nbsp;This means that users need people who can protect their accounts from theft, and sites - from hacking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>System Administrator</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Average salary of a system administrator: 80,000–90,000 rupees.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sysadmins manage the entire IT niche of the company.&nbsp;These people make sure that the software and hardware work properly, the network is protected from cyberattacks, and the employees do not face problems using corporate computers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sysadmin can work together with programmers and have a small staff subordinate, but sometimes he performs all the tasks on his own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is possible to modernize the information infrastructure remotely, so many talented performers are switching to freelance.&nbsp;The list of responsibilities depends on the characteristics of the company (and its scale), but it is difficult to remain without occupation here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Software Tester</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The average salary of a software tester in India is 60,000–80,000 rupees</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Testers are&nbsp;definitely among our top freelancing professions for 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specialists in this area:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Study the developments of programmers for errors in the code.</li><li>Select development tools.</li><li>Provide programmers with recommendations for improving the project.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advantage of a niche is that it is much easier to master than any other area of ​​programming.&nbsp;At the same time, wages are not lower than those of developers, and sometimes even higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list of tasks and methods varies, but most often you have to deal with automatic and manual testing: you need to try to break the code in different ways and see what comes of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is little competition among testers: a separate specialization in this area appeared not so long ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Web design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The average salary depends on the position and direction. An aspiring designer receives from 30,000 to 40,000 rupees, an art director - more than 100,000.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Web design was in the top 10 freelance professions back in 2019, consolidated its position in 2020 and will remain with us in 2021. Those who have mastered this specialty are engaged in the design of online platforms, create beautiful and functional interfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most popular and paid direction is UX design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UX - User Experience - everything related to the interaction of a user and a computer.&nbsp;Designers are working to maximize the usability of the product and make it comfortable for users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A UX designer not only satisfies his creative impulses, but also deals with analytics.&nbsp;Its tasks include studying user behavior and drawing up a portrait of the target audience.&nbsp;It goes like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effectiveness of sales depends on this.&nbsp;If the service is inconvenient to use, the buttons have to be searched for too long, and the purchase process is not fully understood, conversions will be lower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work is difficult, but it pays accordingly. An experienced UX designer with a portfolio can earn up to INR 200,000 per month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Motion design and 3D</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2D and 3D animators receive an average of 60,000-80,000 rupees, depending on the portfolio and region.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Motion design&nbsp;and 3D have not yet made it to the top, but these areas are rapidly gaining popularity.&nbsp;Having mastered them now, by the time of maximum demand, you can go far ahead and take a leading position among competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can already see animated ads from major brands.&nbsp;Adidas and Reebok have such videos - bright and eye-catching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Motion design is also used on web platforms as an interface element.&nbsp;Good animations have not yet become ubiquitous, but they are the most memorable feature of the resource.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designers work on a variety of platforms, from Adobe Photoshop to Cinema 4D.&nbsp;Most often, you have to combine several tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Finding a remote job for a freelancer</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many freelancers start looking for offers on exchanges.&nbsp;Top sites of the world:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://Upwork.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Upwork</a></li><li>Fiverr</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The disadvantages of this method are the rather low payment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an alternative, recruiting sites are used, where you can find both single profitable projects and long-term cooperation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>MonsterIndia</li><li>JobLab</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Higher pay and an abundance of vacancies make this method of job search more preferable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is best to look for remote work through specialized groups on Facebook or Telegram channels with vacancies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Where to get a demanded specialty</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much of the above is not yet taught in universities.&nbsp;The only way to learn new skills is specialized courses for beginners.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Netology you will find courses not only for beginners, but also for professionals who have decided to expand their qualifications.&nbsp;There are different directions:</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->
