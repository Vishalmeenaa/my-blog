<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background"><strong>Why is there no coverage on Instagram?&nbsp;How to increase it and increase your activity on Instagram?&nbsp;Familiar pain?&nbsp;For a few more years, answering these questions was as easy as shelling pears, but then the social network introduced the algorithmic principle of forming a feed, and everything broke.&nbsp;Let's go back to the basics and talk about proven ways to increase reach and raise statistics on Instagram.</strong></p>

<h2 id="najdi-optimalnoe-vremya-dlya-publikatsij">Find the optimal time to post</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the algorithmic principle of forming a user feed, the moment of posting has not lost its significance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good time to post always helps boost your reach.&nbsp;Active engagement will tell algorithms to show content to more people.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-the-best-moment">How to choose the best moment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The easiest way to do this is with a business profile.&nbsp;Its owners have access to an advanced analytical tool - Instagram Insights.&nbsp;With its help, you can understand when representatives of your target audience are most active.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>According to observations, the best time to post on Instagram is evening, but there are no universal recipes, you still have to delve into analytics</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If an increase in reach is needed in a regular account, experiment with the posting date: create a notebook and note when users react to a post the most violently.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manual analysis takes more time, but it is also a fairly accurate technique.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order not to sit at the monitor waiting for a better time, use&nbsp;delayed posting services&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="testiruj-sootnoshenie-formatov">Test the aspect ratio</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Numerous studies show that Instagram images get more likes and comments than videos.&nbsp;But on the basis of such analytics, one cannot draw unambiguous conclusions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps publishing exclusively images is not suitable for a specific project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 id="what-is-the-ambiguity">What is the ambiguity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>User engagement research from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newswhip.com/2016/10/how-publishers-on-instagram-breakdown-their-photo-and-video-strategy/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">News Whip</a>&nbsp;found that photos do generate more likes.&nbsp;But videos get about 2x more comments than hearts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody knows for certain which of the factors is "more expensive" on Instagram.&nbsp;But if you are guided by logic, then you can draw an interesting conclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It takes more effort to write a comment than to get a like.&nbsp;Hence, it can be assumed that content with a lot of comments has priority in ranking, as it motivates users better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="zadavaj-voprosy-i-nbsp-provodi-konkursy">Ask questions and run contests</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Polls and giveaways are classics of promotion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They consistently provide good coverage on Instagram, as they form a motivated and direct appeal to the audience for actions “useful” for the account.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The main thing is that polls and competitions are really interesting and easy to perform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some examples of successful options for engaging in activity:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>please show a funny themed emoji combination;</li><li>a call to mark the user with the most creative signature in the account on the page;</li><li>flash mob "Tell me about the last book / game / movie";</li><li>please draw a picture of a brand or event.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>One of the most successful contests in our projects is the drawing of two nights in the Burj Khalifa.&nbsp;Participants need to subscribe to an account, like and mark a friend in the comments</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For contests to steadily raise the asset on Instagram, you need to know when to stop.&nbsp;One successful campaign does not mean that the next one should be launched in a few days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contests and polls get bored quickly.&nbsp;Therefore, they should rarely be carried out, but with a really worthwhile idea.</p>

<h2 id="rabotaj-s-nbsp-polzovatelskim-kontentom">Work with custom content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowdtap research has shown that user-generated content is 50% more trusted and 35% more accepted by the audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The own publications of commercial accounts are usually associated with advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="razmeshhaj-istorii">Post stories</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even children today know how to make a story.&nbsp;This is a very popular format that is good at stimulating audience engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stories are located above the main feed, so it is difficult for users to "pass by".&nbsp;It has already been noticed that for Instagram algorithms, popular stories are a powerful positive signal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Activities can be combined.&nbsp;For example, in an automotive project, we conducted a survey in Stories</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="ispolzuj-reklamu">Use ads</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the obviousness of this recommendation, it cannot be ignored.&nbsp;Social media promotion, including Instagram, is becoming more and more challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most popular platforms are actively involved in monetization.&nbsp;Therefore, conditions are created in which significant success cannot be achieved without advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, Instagram ads are expensive, but you can work with them on a very limited budget.&nbsp;To do this, you need to learn to understand your target audience and set up internal targeting.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then even a small amount is enough to achieve significant coverage with the help of advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="publikuj-bez-fanatizma">Publish without fanaticism</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today users are faced with an avalanche of content every day.&nbsp;If you load your audience with a large number of questionable posts, expect only a small coverage on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is always better to post a couple of really interesting photos than to fill the feed with mediocre pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rare publications of high-quality content form an expectation of a holiday among subscribers, akin to an information hunger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a social network is seen as a promising platform for promotion, forget about cross-posting and copying materials from other sites.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Instagram, you need to create an exclusive.&nbsp;They must exactly match the format and expectations of the target audience.&nbsp;Remember: bright visuals are valued above all else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="sleduj-trendam">Follow the trends</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real audience activity can only be&nbsp;achieved by following trends&nbsp;and maintaining a truly live account.&nbsp;The business needs to use all available formats and tools.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, many people forget that new arrivals in an online store can be shown in stories.&nbsp;Make a carousel of beautiful product photos in the feed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1754,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Live streaming is an easy and inexpensive way to warm up your audience and answer hot questions</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another tool that is undeservedly rarely used to increase reach is live streaming.&nbsp;You don't have to stream lengthy streams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is enough to go live for a couple of minutes to show something really interesting or funny.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Broadcasting is direct communication with the audience that increases trust and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, broadcasts are given priority in the user's feed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="avtomatiziruj">Automate</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the broadest sense of this concept, promotion on Instagram is the race to obtain maximum audience reach.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content creation, communication with users, analytics and other activities are just means of achieving the main goal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
