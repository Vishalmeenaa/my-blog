<p>It's easy to add new tasks, information, or fields or move views after you've created another project workboard. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The user interface is very simple. In the default list view, you will see an overview of all your tasks in a project.  If you click on a task list, it will appear on the right side of the list, complete with all its descriptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6903,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<h2>2. Project Management Templates</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Asana</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6905,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Templates-in-Asana-1536x874-1-1024x583.png" alt="Templates-in-Asana" class="wp-image-6905"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asana has tons of templates to help you build to-do lists quickly.  Asana shows templates relevant to various industries, such as marketing, products, architecture, IT, operations, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can choose the appropriate template after you have successfully registered. You can also change the template if needed to make it relevant to your project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6906,"width":775,"height":369,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Monday-templates-1024x488.png" alt="Monday templates" class="wp-image-6906" width="775" height="369"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday also offers a <a href="https://monday.com/templates" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://monday.com/templates" rel="noreferrer noopener">collection of templates</a> categorized by industry type. However, the templates offered on Monday.com are different from Asana.  Monday.com provides even better quality templates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The templates are not just a few sample content, but they are designed to look like real project plans with real content tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Asana, the project plan prototype reveals three examples of total activity, an indirect template containing the user responsible for the task, a direct description, or a deadline date. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the plan template that Monday.com offers features seven assignments, three of which are entirely populated for the task owner, design status, implementation status, approval, schedule, and progress or progress. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both applications have models, but the Monday application offers templates that are more comprehensive and have real-world relevance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Winner:&nbsp;Monday.com</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Task Management</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Asana</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asana has built in several ways to create new tasks and monitor their status to make task management as simple as possible. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6910,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Add-tasks-in-Asana.png" alt="Add-tasks-in-Asana" class="wp-image-6910"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you can use the pop-up window to enter the task name, task owner, and task description and select a project folder for the task. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second way is to go to the project folder and add a task by completing the description, deadline, and assignment owner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6909,"width":534,"height":531,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Asana-task-creation.png" alt="Asana-task-creation" class="wp-image-6909" width="534" height="531"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For reporting, Asana also generates three types of reports to help you view all your tasks: a list of all the tasks you have generated, the tasks you have delegated to others, and the tasks you have recently completed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6911,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Task-creation-in-monday.com_-1024x255.png" alt="Task-creation-in-monday.com_" class="wp-image-6911"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday.com helps users create tasks by requesting as many task details as possible, such as task owner, task status report (which is color-coded), task timeline, and progress for each mission, all available on the task board. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To add a new assignment on Monday.com, you need to enter the required project folder, open it, and enter all the detailed information about the work.  Of course, you can remove specific data fields from the project plan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6912,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Monday.coms-advanced-task-features.png" alt="Monday.coms-advanced-task-features" class="wp-image-6912"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is especially good if you and your work team want all the work details to be on the platform and prevent wasting time discussing things that are not clear about the assignment.  This detail will ultimately be of great help to the project manager to pull up reports for all your assignments and projects.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Format View</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Asana</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since visualizing tasks in list form or format isn't always the best way to see details, Asana provides several other ways to visualize your work. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can display your tasks in a list, timeline, and calendar within each project. In File view, you can view a gallery of all project attachments in one location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday provides more project-level visualization options, including the ability to display data in tables, timeline timelines, sign boards, calendars, charts, or workflow maps. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday takes care of everything for you, translating project data quickly into the view you want.</p>

<p><strong>Winner:&nbsp;Monday.com</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Integration with other Software</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Asana</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compared to most other project management systems, Asana has the most integrations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asana has over 200 integrations with much other popular software, from Dropbox to Slack to GitHub to Mailchimp.  Apart from that, Asana also has its own API.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Full list of asana integration <a href="https://asana.com/apps" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://asana.com/apps" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6907,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Monday.com, because this management project is still relatively new, as of this writing, Monday.com has only about 40 integrations (see full list <a href="https://monday.com/integrations" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://monday.com/integrations" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a>) and its own API. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6908,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/monday.com-integrations-1024x587.png" alt="monday.com integrations " class="wp-image-6908"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of some Monday integrations with popular software include Slack, Jira, Google Drive, Shopify, MailChimp, and many more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a small company, this may be sufficient because Monday may already be integrated with the CRM software and marketing automation platforms that you are already using. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for medium to large companies, you may need to share API data if the integration is not yet on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Winner:&nbsp;<a href="https://waytoidea.com/Recommended/asana/" target="_blank" aria-label="Asana (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Asana</a></strong></p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Asana</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Data replication, backup, and recovery are all available on the Asana platform. Data can also be exported in JSON or CSV format.  SSL links, TLS 1.1 encryption, SOC2 Type 1 and 2 certifications, and member and guest controls via the admin console are examples of the security features Asana has. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All Asana servers are stored in SSAE 16 audited data centers with firewalls, and only Asana employees have access.  However, to find this information, I first had to browse in-depth, and it was very time-consuming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, Monday.com understands the importance of consumer data and puts it directly on the website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday emphasizes its dedication to providing a very stable, reliable, and trustworthy atmosphere.  There is compliance with GDPR, ISO 27001 and 27018 certifications, the EU-US privacy shield system, SOC1 Type 2, SOC2 Type 2, SOC 3 certifications, and HIPAA compliance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of this is proof that Monday has good world-class safety standards. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from that, there are also built-in security features, such as data encryption in transit and inactive, multi-factor authentication, SSO for Google, Okta, OneLogin, SAML, and advanced session management software. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the factor of disclosure of information regarding security, I will make Monday.com the winner!</p>
