<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Main Image Formats?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before diving into the topic of Image compression tools that can help you reduce the size of your photos, you have to know all the image formats. You can work with any of them on your page but they have their peculiarities:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>JPG:</strong> This is one of the most used on different websites. However, it is not functional if you need a vector or flat design images.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>PNG:</strong> if you need vector graphic elements, this is the ideal format, it is also widely used in infographic. And also in the case of images without a background, they are interesting to create your designs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>GIF</strong>: although this format is more used in social networks, where they have great reach and receptivity, it is not common to see it in blogs. However, some people use them, but you have to bear in mind that it can affect the loading speed because they are very heavy in the case of being animated.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>SVG</strong> - This is a vector format that some people are starting to use. But it is still not as famous as PNG. It allows you to modify the image on the website itself (sizes, colors) without uploading the modified image again.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>WebP:</strong> this format that has been developed by Google is also recent. It intends to combine the advantages of JPG, PNG, and GIF to create a universal format.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
