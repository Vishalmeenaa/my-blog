<h2>BlogSpot SEO: Useful Tips and Tricks:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we talk about SEO, the very first thing which you need to keep in mind is: We can control on-site and <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/off-page-seo/" target="_blank" aria-label="off-site SEO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">off-site SEO</a>. On-Page SEO is covered by you, including article quality, how well it’s optimized for Keyword and meta value for that article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No need to feel lost with the above SEO terminologies, as the guide below would help you learn and make your Blogger blog more search engine friendly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Format Blogger Post URL Link</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Permalink plays a significant role in the search engine ranking of your post. Therefore, there are a few rules which everyone should follow for Blogspot permalinks:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep the number of characters in the post title to 50</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remove Stop Words from the permalink (Ex: A, An, The)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While writing a blog post, you have the option to edit the permalink. Use it to edit your permalink and remove the stop words. The good idea is to use Keywords in your permalink. (Don’t make it look spammy).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While writing the blog post, you get the option in your right panel to keep it automatic permalink or manual permalink. So select the manual permalink and edit it according to your wish. Check this screenshot for example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Custom BlogSpot Permalink</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","width":366,"height":226} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Custom-BlogSpot-Permalink.jpg" alt="Custom-BlogSpot-Permalink" width="366" height="226"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Maintain the Keyword Density</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword density is an essential aspect for better ranking. Too less will lead to less ranking, and stuffing your Keyword will lead to over-optimization. Therefore, I usually maintain a ratio of 2%/post along with LSI keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though you can pick <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/keyword-density-checker/" target="_blank" aria-label="keyword density (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">keyword density</a> for your Blogpost SEO, account to one which works for you. Publish articles in relevance to post title and include necessary keywords in the post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Never stuff keywords to manipulate search engines. But after finish writing, you can analyze the whole post to find suitable locations where the keywords can be safely inserted without distracting readers. You can also use Frase, which helps you in content optimization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Blogspot Proper labels and Related Posts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Labels in BlogSpot adds to the keyword density of the post. Therefore, labels should be widened rather than putting them into a single narrow category. I will explain this point by example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider a situation when you are posting about Google Chrome and labeling Windows software or browser. Here you will miss keywords like Chrome browser, Google Chrome, etc., which would otherwise add to the keyword density of the whole post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Labels also affect related post widgets in Blogger. And if there are so many posts tagged with similar labels, it would affect the arrangement of articles in related posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Format Blogger Post Title</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we talk about BlogSpot SEO, post title plays a significant role. Blogger post title is usually followed by home page title. Have a look at the image shown below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","width":663,"height":44} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/blogger-post-title.png" alt="blogger-post-title" width="663" height="44"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Here the post title should be “city of (long-distance ) Love! “. But the title is included in the home page title ” Still in Berlin, “which would harm the SEO friendliness of the article title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Format Blogspot Images for SEO</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have already shared a detailed article on Image optimization for SEO. The basis of optimizing your image on BlogSpot is by adding alt tags and title tags in every image. In WordPress, this could be easily achieved by using plugins, but in BlogSpot, this needs to be done manually. Therefore, you should insert them manually after uploading each image.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Provide Meta Tags (Updated)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meta tags are generated HTML tags used by search engines to identify the title, description, and other URL details. They don’t have much influence on search as they were before but would slightly impact targeted keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Provide a Good Title, and Description</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The title, footer, and description play an essential role in the search engine optimization of every blog. Therefore, if you are targeting, some keywords make sure that you included those keywords in the locations mentioned above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Nofollow External Links</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nofollow is an HTML attribute specified on hyperlinks to block search engine advantage of external links in a website. For example, in Blogger, you can select the HTML section of the post window and add the rel=” no follow” attribute just after the URL to prevent search engines from crawling a particular link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Format Comment Section</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Comment section should be no-followed and moderated to avoid spam comments. Try to include the post keywords when you are replying to reader comments. This would also add up to the total keyword density of the post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Blogspot</strong>&nbsp;is Google’s baby blogging platform, and if you do it right probably, you will be doing great regarding traffic. So always get your fundamental right.</p>
