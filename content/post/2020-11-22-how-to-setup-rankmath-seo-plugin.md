<h2>Advantages of Rank Math SEO over Yoast SEO</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are not going to walk around with little girls, so we started this article by telling you the aspects in which Rank Math SEO surpasses Yoast SEO. Thus, you will understand from the first moment why we are so sure that Rank Math can unseat the one who has been a great favourite until now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Interface</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though both plugins have practical and easy-to-use interfaces, Rank Math SEO's is more intuitive and has a more striking and visually attractive aesthetic that improves the user experience.&nbsp;<strong>Useful functionality and careful aesthetics</strong>&nbsp;are the perfect combinations to achieve a friendly interface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Keyword integration</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you may already know, Yoast SEO allows you to choose a keyword to target the content of a post. Well, Rank Math SEO will enable you to choose up to&nbsp;<strong>five keywords</strong>&nbsp;for each post. If you only have one, the plugin will suggest other related keywords, both long-tail and straightforward<em>,</em>&nbsp;so that you can continue to improve your text, making it more search engine friendly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Integration with Google Search Console</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both plugins have this function, but the advantage of Rank Math SEO over Yoast SEO is that it allows you to&nbsp;<strong>consult the Google Search Console data from the WordPress</strong>&nbsp;dashboard, while with Yoast SEO, you have to go directly to the page. It may seem like a trivial advantage, but we assure you that it is much more comfortable working from a single page.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Automatic nofollow tag assignment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are well versed in some HTML, you will know that it is no mystery to manually place the "no follow" tag on outgoing links to not convey authority to them. If you do not have that knowledge or want to make your life easier, Rank Math SEO allows you to&nbsp;<strong>assign this tag automatically</strong>, as we will explain below. Yoast SEO does not have any similar option, so the advantage of Rank Math SEO in this regard is more than evident.</p>

<h3>Content analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most valued functions of Yoast SEO is that it analyzes the content as it is written, giving recommendations and indicating the degree of readability and SEO optimization. Rank Math SEO has improved it by providing&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;much more exact&nbsp;<strong>numerical score from 1 to 100</strong>&nbsp;and concrete tips to improve the text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Rank Math SEO has its tool to do a quick audit of your Website. Indeed, it will not provide you with the same information as a specialized tool, but it is handy to take a look and&nbsp;<strong>know how things are going in terms of your Website's positioning</strong>. Yoast SEO has no such option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to these advantages, Rank Math SEO has other functions such as&nbsp;<strong>integration with WooCommerce</strong>&nbsp;that are available for free, while with Yoast SEO, they can only be used in the paid version.</p>
