But it is not the only one, and the WordPress alternatives that exist are increasingly interesting due to their power, versatility, and innovation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress already powers more than 40% of the websites on the Internet. There is nothing. However, these&nbsp;<strong>WordPress alternatives&nbsp;</strong>to starting a blog or online store that we will talk about are also growing a lot in the coming years and they offer new options to tackle web projects efficiently and sometimes faster or with features that are not easy to find in the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing the WordPress alternatives will allow you to be able to choose the tool that best suits your way of working to increase the profitability of your projects and also the satisfaction of your clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growth of CMS Tools</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress was one of the first content creation platforms or CMS (<strong>Content Management System</strong>) and its adaptation to the needs of professionals quickly led it to lead the market. There was a time when it seemed like the only alternative, but that is not the case today, so keep an open mind to discover them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2020, more than 65% of the websites created worldwide were made with a CMS platform. <a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/cms-stats/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://firstsiteguide.com/cms-stats/" rel="noreferrer noopener">35% with WordPress</a>, yes, but also with these new platforms that are growing, on their own merits, at a fast pace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of them are what we call no-code or low-code tools to create websites with JUST technical knowledge and allow anyone to tackle professional projects. They only require dedication, time, and learning to handle the selected platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although WordPress is the best known, more and more people think that new applications are more powerful and easier to use than the famous open source software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best WordPress Alternatives</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, we are going to review the main alternatives that exist in the market:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wix</a></h3>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wix is ​​a cloud-based website builder that made a big splash in the market thanks to an incredible promotion and advertising campaign on different digital channels, and even some traditional ones like television.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a very simple and intuitive tool with which to <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a blog or website</a>. It uses a system of drag and drop that allows users to place the different elements that make up the web in the location they want, as well as resize them to fit the design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a couple of years now, with its Editor X, it has had a more advanced option for users looking for a little more customization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wix Strengths:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Agility</strong>: One of the great advantages of Wix is ​​that it speeds up the entire web design and development process, allowing you to have a functional website in just a few hours of work.</li>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the great appearances of recent years on no-code platforms for&nbsp;<strong>creating apps and web pages</strong>&nbsp;is Bubble. It is a very visual tool that makes it easy for the user to create the basic elements of an app, placing them where they think is most appropriate, changing their size, and assigning the personalized functions that they carry out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating an app without writing a single line of code is possible thanks to this application, making it one of the most interesting tools today.</p>
