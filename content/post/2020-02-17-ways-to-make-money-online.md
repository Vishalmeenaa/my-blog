<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Join the Affiliate Program</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to get money from the internet is by joining an affiliate program. You will recommend or review a product sold by a merchant (which has an affiliate program). The review includes an affiliate link. If this link is clicked and the buyer makes a purchase for the product being promoted, you will earn a commission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitcatcha.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bitcatcha</strong></a>, for example, reviews hosting services, VPN apps, and site builders. Every time a review is published, it must include an affiliate link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the results are not much, at least some sites make affiliates their primary income. The amount of revenue earned is up to millions of dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, Wirecutter had a fortune that was large enough to the point that the New York Times acquired it for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/24/nyt-wirecutter/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>$ 30 million</strong></a>. Other examples are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.lucieslist.com/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Lucieslist</strong></a>, a site that reviews baby products, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Outdoorgearlab</strong></a>, a site that reviews camping and hiking equipment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow an affiliate program that fits your blog niche. For example, if your blog theme revolves around technology and computers,&nbsp;<strong>Hostinger's Affiliate program</strong>&nbsp;is a great choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After creating an affiliate account with Hostinger, you will be given access to the affiliate marketing dashboard. It is on this dashboard that you can manage and even check all affiliate campaigns. Use pre-made affiliate material, such as banners, ebooks, and infographics, and increase sales through your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hostinger offers many types of hosting to promote. If you feel you can get more benefits by recommending other products, please consult with your Account Manager first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Build an Online Store</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ECommerce sites, also known as online shops, are gaining popularity these days. What's more, with platforms like&nbsp;<strong>WordPress</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>WooCommerce</strong>, creating an eCommerce site has&nbsp;<strong>never been</strong>&nbsp;easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you prefer to sell physical products,&nbsp;<strong>having an online store</strong>&nbsp;is the best choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two methods to consider for your online store to be successful:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create and sell products to your target audience. Make sure the product fits the chosen niche.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>You are purchasing manufactured goods at lower prices from abroad. After that, give it a new packaging and resell it at an increased price.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who choose the first method, you have to do product research, product development, and product testing. All of this is done so that the online store business that is run makes a large profit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of online stores that are&nbsp;<strong>gaining</strong>&nbsp;success are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.skinnymetea.com.au/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>SkinnyMe Tea</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.beardbrand.com/"><strong>Beardbrand</strong></a>, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ratiocoffee.com/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Ratio Coffee</strong></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you think the first method is too risky, especially for beginners, choose the second method. Look for popular products across multiple platforms, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://aliexpress.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link"><strong>AliExpress</strong></a>. Pack it back in a new feel and display it in your online shop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also try the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.abetterlemonadestand.com/what-is-drop-shipping/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>drop shipping</strong></a>&nbsp;method if you want shipping to be arranged by the manufacturer or supplier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Become a Reseller of Web Host</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can make passive income by becoming a Web Hosting reseller. This program provides an opportunity for anyone who wants to earn income by becoming a reseller hosting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A reseller hosting provider will provide dedicated server space for its users to build their web hosting brand. Later you can:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a web hosting account equipped with cPanel.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Set resource limits (for example, disk space and bandwidth).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Manage all accounts using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cpanel.com/demo/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>WHM</strong></a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>cPanel</strong>&nbsp;is a widely used tool for managing hosting accounts. You can make this tool an advantage to attract as many clients as possible to subscribe to your hosting. Also, emphasize that server uptime is monitored by an in-house team of administrators so that uptime and performance remain stable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Opening an Online Course</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Online courses are increasingly being conducted. People don't mind spending some money on online courses to enrich themselves with information and knowledge. If you have an advantage in a field, there is nothing wrong with opening an online course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, train yourself to teach online.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitdegree.org/become-instructor" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>BitDegree</strong></a>, a learning platform, provides a program to become an instructor or trainer in online courses. This program is a great opportunity because you can channel your skills and experience to thousands of people who want to learn new things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Online courses take many forms. Ranging from simple PDFs can be downloaded to a series of instructional videos with a total duration of tens of hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conducting online courses does not always have to be accompanied by expensive registration fees. You can adjust how much the registrant will need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the advantages of online courses is that they can be integrated with modern websites, such as blogs, eCommerce platforms, and affiliate marketing sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make it easier to choose course topics, you can ask the audience for help in the form of a&nbsp;<em>poll</em>. But sometimes, you can just ask their opinion right away. Many will provide solutions and topics that can be studied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, the&nbsp;<strong>Learn Scrivener Fast</strong>&nbsp;online course is aimed at writers who want to learn the ins and outs of the&nbsp;<strong>Scrivener</strong>&nbsp;software. As the organizer, Joseph Michael got the topic idea by reading the comments column on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://michaelhyatt.com/blog/"><strong>Michael Hyatt's blog</strong></a>. To date, Learn Scrivener has managed to become a high-income online course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Offer a Membership System</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Membership sites are attracting a lot of interest lately. The manufacturing process is also easy, although the number of audiences visiting the website is a significant factor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://markmanson.net/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Mark Manson</strong></a>&nbsp;runs a blog on self-development. On its site, it offers a membership system so readers can access additional online courses, videos, and articles. For those who like their blog content, this subscription and membership service is like a golden ticket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the example above, it can be concluded that the audience visited the site or blog because they liked the content discussed and also the way it was delivered. These people will most likely become loyal visitors to your blog.&nbsp;<em>Well</em>, this is where you can offer a membership system so that visitors can access premium content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not everyone will be interested in the membership promo that you echo. However, this promo will be a special offer for those who like the content on your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presented membership system depends on the website's type or theme and how much premium content you want to create. If you are interested in getting money from the internet, please read the tutorial on&nbsp;<strong>creating a WordPress membership website</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Renting out advertising space</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many sites advertise in the middle of content. Some look boring and don't match the content, but some are in line with the website's content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, the rental of advertising space is done by websites that already have high traffic. If the number of traffic to your site continues to grow, this way of getting money quickly from the internet can be considered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from advertising network policies, payment is also based on total impressions or clicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An ad network that is quite popular among bloggers and website owners is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Google AdSense</strong></a>. To use it, you need to register yourself. If accepted, the ad can already be placed on your site. The commission earned from Adsense ads is not that big unless your website gets millions of visits per month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from Google AdSense, there is also&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ezoic.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ezoic</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.net/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Media</strong></a>, which will evaluate the registered websites. Use these two networks to optimize and maximize ad revenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advertising can also be done without the need to join an impressive network. If you have succeeded in building an audience, you can try renting out advertising space to other similar businesses. For example, suppose that your website contains a variety of information about sleep management. To earn income through advertising, you can offer advertising space rental services to&nbsp;mattress companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another option is to create paid content. Companies will pay you to write sponsored content. This content will be posted on your site. Some sites that implement this method are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://advertise.buzzfeed.com/"><strong>Buzzfeed</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://millo.co/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Millo</strong></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Offering Services and Services on the Website</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to earn income from the internet is by offering services and services on the website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two strategies, namely:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Create an Educational Blog</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make a blog containing one crucial topic. Let's say you have a blog that discusses woodworking techniques. Then you've succeeded in getting visitors to subscribe to site content. The traffic is increasing and stable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Well</em>, the next strategy is to add a service page that contains info and lessons about carpentry. This learning can be private (per one subscriber) or channeled through media, such as Skype.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Creating a Simple Website</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple website on the WordPress platform</strong></a>&nbsp;and offer your services to individuals and companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, suppose you are looking for a job opening for freelance writers. Choose the right niche and start building a simple website. Add some essential pages containing your information, services offered, and examples of writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find leads by guest posting, podcast interviews, or running a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gmass.co/blog/3-clever-ways-drastically-increase-cold-email-outreach-roi/" class="rank-math-link"><strong><em>cold outreach</em></strong></a>&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want a more satisfying result, combine the two methods above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Creating a Locker Site with a Subscription System</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you know that locker sites can also be a source of income from the internet?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a locker website, those looking for workers with specific criteria will place advertisements on your site. Visitors can apply for the job in droves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two ways to make money online through this site, namely charging fees to locker advertisers and applying a monthly subscription fee for visitors so they can view available job vacancies and send applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before making space for locker ads, try to get your site to get as much traffic as possible. Employers will not publish job advertisements on a site that cannot link qualified and qualified job seekers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example of a successful locker website is the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://problogger.com/jobs/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>ProBlogger Job Board</strong></a>. The method used is to impose locker ad posting fees for companies and individuals alike. As for job seekers, they can access and apply in their desired fields for free. This site is also successful in building online personas with a large audience. There is no doubt that there will be hundreds of job seekers interested in one locker ad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Online Directory Business</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although not very popular, online directories can be one way to get money from the internet quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The system is almost the same as the locker website. It's just that, if on the locker website, individuals or companies have to pay to place advertisements or visitors have to pay a subscription fee to access job vacancies. Meanwhile, in online directories, you will get paid monthly for one&nbsp;<em>directory listing</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your site is credible or has a high amount of traffic, online directory services will give you excess benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's say that the main topic of a site is web development and design. Through this site, you often produce quality content that can ultimately bring in a large audience. Then you start creating a directory so web developers and agencies can buy listings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from providing&nbsp;<em>authoritative backlinks,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;online directories can also bring traffic to a business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, there will be a monthly subscription fee to get the company or business on the list. There is even a premium fee that will ensure its position to continue to be in the top position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Selling Websites</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the way to make money online from websites is by selling them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yep, you heard right! <a href="https://bebiggy.com/websites-for-sale/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bebiggy.com/websites-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selling a website</a> that is owned will generate rupiah coffers. But of course, the amount of profit earned depends on the type and quality of the website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selling value of the website will be higher than the income you usually receive per month. In general, the amount of sales figure depends on several factors. But don't worry. You can still apply a selling price of 12 to 30 times your monthly passive income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the factors that affect the final result of website sales:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Website age.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Domain authority or ownership.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Amount of traffic the website receives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Amount of profit the website makes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Income diversification.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Income stability.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Website development is their progress, or is it even 'on the way.'</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

<h3>32. Create a Podcast</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lately, many people choose to become podcasters (the name for those who make podcasts) if you like to share stories or research information by conducting interviews—making podcasts can help get money from the internet, even without using PayPal payments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Podcasts can be listened to anywhere, whether at home or when the listener is on a trip. Not only that, but podcasts can also be listened to at any time of the day or night. This is what then makes the podcast have a lot of fans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two things to consider to become a successful podcaster, namely audio quality, and content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who choose interview podcasts, make a list of sources that match the topic to be delivered. Practice with friends, relatives, or family. Ask questions as if you were interviewing a source. This way, you will be better prepared to release your first podcast!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get a picture of how podcasts work, take some time and listen to podcasts on iTunes or Spotify. Listen to a few podcasters, then note what they have in common.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>39. Film Subtitle Translator (Subtitler)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Movie lovers are now increasingly diverse. The language choices presented are not only English or Mandarin. Those of you who master Korean, Japanese, or even German, can try your luck to become a freelance translator for film subtitles (subtitles). In addition to sharpening language skills, working as a subtitler also trains sensitivity and creativity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of words and sentences must be by the context, storyline, and simple and easy for the audience to digest. Even a subtitler must understand the term humor when working on a translation for a comedy film. This is to maintain the element of humor conveyed in the film. If translated literally or the word's use is not correct, a film's message will fail to be conveyed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to mastering foreign languages, the requirements to become a subtitler are like watching movies, following the development of the world of films, not getting bored quickly when sitting for hours because you have to listen to the storyline, have a lot of vocabulary (you can read books), and most importantly, can work fast under pressure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>So</em>, if you are interested in this field, you can try applying through sites such as&nbsp;Jobstreet,&nbsp;Sribulancer, or Upwork. Join the local community to get tips and tricks about translation. Not infrequently, you can even get freelancer jobs in the community.</p>

<h3>40. Corrector or Proofreader</h3>

If you are very thorough and understand the standard of correct and correct language and writing, being a corrector is the right job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Book publishers generally offer this profession. You can send your application through the official website or visit the office in person. However, if you want to work from home, you can check out the Freelancers<strong> sites</strong>. These two sites will connect you with clients who need proofreader services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
