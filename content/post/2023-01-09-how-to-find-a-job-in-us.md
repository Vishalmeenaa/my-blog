<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, even in the land of opportunity, it can be challenging to find a job these days, and if you aren’t a citizen, even more so. Here are the best ways anyone can find a job in the U.S. today.</p>

<h2>Online Job Sites</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The internet has become an essential part of any job search. Countless websites allow you to search for job postings and upload your résumé online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make the most of the time you spend searching online by using job search engines and job alerts. Job search engines collect job listings from hundreds of websites so you can view them in a single place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also save time by creating a job alert, a summary of new job postings from a specific search that is sent to your email. Receiving only a few job listings each day will allow you to see the latest opportunities without having to sort through a long list of search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When employers need to fill a job opening, they can search through online job boards to find a candidate that fits their needs. Making your résumé available by posting it online can increase your chances of finding a job.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One job search site that is highly recommended is Lensa. This website is extremely effective and operates from a job seeker's perspective. You can upload your résumé and complete a detailed profile to help Lensa’s algorithm find the best fitting job for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Searching for employment online has made it easier than ever to discover new opportunities. When you use these powerful resources, you put yourself one step closer to landing your next job.</p>

<h2>Networking </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone in business and <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/increase-sales-using-email-marketing/">marketing</a> knows that connections are extremely important, particularly in terms of opportunity generation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Actively planning to undertake networking is extremely important because of its benefits. You can expand your network through conferences, events, and <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/increase-social-media-presence/">social media</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the primary benefits is interest generation or motivation. Meeting people in various fields or industries and learning about them can create interest for you to follow in a given career field or path or not follow a given career field or path.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Networking gives you a taste of the given direction as to what you ultimately want to do in life. The people you meet can be of direct assistance, meaning they could hire you or undertake to facilitate your career development needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another very crucial upside to networking is your connections’ referrals. At times, you can make a connection with someone who understands you. They know what you're looking for and what you want professionally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When this happens, that individual can refer you to others, and all of a sudden, you have extended your network to include elements of their network too.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This gets your foot in the door of any career path you are interested in taking because you get to communicate with multiple people who have experience and connections of their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This gives you one thing anyone looking for a job desperately needs, opportunity. Having a large network of people who understand you and what you want to do is a great source for letting you know when an opportunity arises.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oftentimes, you wouldn't even be able to hear about them anywhere else, as it is estimated that over 50% of jobs in The United States are never publicly posted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you take government sector jobs out of the equation and just look at private sector jobs, that statistic grows between 75% to 80%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are, of course, companies that hire work through recruiters, but the majority of mid-sized companies hire through referrals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being aware of that, you should make certain to expand your network as much as possible so that these connections can ultimately be an aid to you in terms of not just finding a job but future career development.</p>

<p>For those who are not American citizens, still make sure to consider searching online through job sites and expanding your network, however, there is an extra hoop you will need to jump through. Anyone who is not an American citizen needs a work visa to be employed in The United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 14 different <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/people/immigrants/visa.html">visa classifications that allow you to work in The United States</a>, each of them has different requirements for different needs specific to an individual, so make sure to research which one is most suitable for you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time your work visa processes will highly depend on the type of visa you applied for. Generally, it takes about three to five weeks for a U.S. visa application to get processed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If, after the processing, you get a positive reply on your application, it will take about two to seven months for the USCIS to process a work permit application.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This sounds like a long time, but you can use that time to your benefit by networking or preparing as much as you can for your future job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
