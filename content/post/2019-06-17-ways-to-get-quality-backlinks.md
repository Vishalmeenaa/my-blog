<p>Whenever we talk about SEO, we divide it into on-page and off-page SEO. Off-site SEO mainly contains backlinks and social signals. Especially, to boost your ranking in SERP’s you need to get quality links from other authority sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know the importance of search engine traffic and that getting high-quality backlinks to your blog is one of the best ways to improve your blog's rankings and get better search engine traffic and results, this post will be listing 101 ways by which you can get quality backlinks to your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though before we move ahead, here are things that you need to keep in mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2012, Google launched Penguin update, which is targeted to get rid of sites using spammy or paid ways to build links. Also, many ways which I mentioned in the article are not so good ways to get quality backlinks, so I will strikethrough such ways and you can ignore them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, when you are building backlinks, you need to keep the quality of links and anchor text variation in your mind. Also, instead of creating lots of backlinks to your homepage only, start working on building links to internal pages. You can start working on resource pages like “WordPress guide” and build links to them. This way, you can also target Single or double-word Keywords easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the link building methods, which you should ignore:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before, I start with my 101 lists, here are some of the link building methods that you should ignore:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Avoid site-wide links from footer (WordPress themes or plugins)</li><li>Avoid buying exact anchor text link (Keep a proportion of 40%-20%–20%-10%-10% for anchor text variation)</li><li>Avoid buying bulk links from sites like Fiverr</li><li>Don’t opt for link networks (Build my rank was one of such private link networks, which got penalized)</li><li>Avoid BlogRoll links</li><li>Article directory links are not that effective anymore</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, these are something that you should keep in mind when starting with a quality backlink-building campaign. Out of all the existing methods, guest posting is the best way to get a quality link, and it will help you to drive traffic to your web page.</p>
