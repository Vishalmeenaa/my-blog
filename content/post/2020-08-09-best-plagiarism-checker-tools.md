<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was an advantage of knowing what the Plagiarism Checker Tool is Best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the plagiarism checker tools above, all but&nbsp;<strong>DupliChecker</strong>&nbsp;picked up on the plagiarised passages. Two, including&nbsp;<strong>PlagScan</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Plagiam</strong>, also identified the paraphrased sections, making these slightly more sensitive and useful.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grammarly and ProWritingAid also offered some additional perks, including proofreading and insights into grammar for perfect writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d consider using&nbsp;<strong>DupliChecker</strong>&nbsp;as a plagiarism checker tool too. It offers a combo of comprehensive detection and editing tools — and don’t mind paying for excellent services. The free version of PlagScan was a favorite, as well, and I picked up everything I expected it to.</p>
