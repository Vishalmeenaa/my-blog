<p><strong>21 Powerful Ways to Speed Up WordPress Website</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Enable WordPress Caching</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caching is one of the best tricks to speed up loading WordPress websites. There are some of the <a aria-label="best caching plugins you can use (opens in a new tab)" href="https://waytoidea.com/best-wordpress-caching-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">best caching plugins you can use</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":718,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WordPress-Caching-plugins-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-718"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, or LiteSpeed ​​Cache. This caching plugin will work on creating static HTML files. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This file is what users will access again more quickly because it presents stored data. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That way, server performance will be lighter, and pages accessed faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The caching plugin also has various additional functions, such as minify HTML files, CSS, and browser caching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Using the Latest Version of WordPress</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress is an open-source that is constantly evolving and improving. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In each update, there are bug fixes from the previous version and also update features. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of speed, the latest version of WordPress is undoubtedly more optimal, and the problem of vulnerabilities is more resolved. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, legacy versions of WordPress tend to be slower and vulnerable to security threats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Enable Image Compression</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":3828,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-Compression-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3828"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Images are often a problem for website speed. Large images on the website will undoubtedly increase the loading of the website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, it is important to ensure that the image is optimally compressed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An excellent way to compress images is to minimize the image size but still look with a good resolution. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To solve this, you can use the partial compression plugin Wp-Smush</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wp-Smush will help optimize images throughout the website while maintaining the solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don't want to use a plugin, you can also use image compression websites, such as&nbsp;<a aria-label="Tinypng (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Tinypng</a>, <a aria-label="Compressor.io (opens in a new tab)" href="https://compressor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Compressor.io</a> etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Remove Unnecessary Plugins</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, more plugins will increase the loading time of the website. This doesn't mean that you have to delete multiple plugins at once. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the fact, plugins are an essential part of building a WordPress website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But here, you need to consider which plugins do not need or have complementary and similar functions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remove unnecessary plugins and keep plugins that support website functionality and optimization.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Speed Up WordPress Website with CDN</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":3829,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/use-CDN-to-Speed-up-WordPress-website-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3829"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</strong> is a geographically dispersed network of data servers. Using a CDN will reduce latency and increase the speed of the server in serving content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CDN works by serving static content to each data server on the network. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This request is received by the webserver to be forwarded to the server closest to the client's location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cloudflare CDN is best, You can use WP-Rocket to direct add-ons. I'm also using Cloudflare CDN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Use a Lightweight WordPress Theme</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When choosing a WordPress theme, appearance should not be your only consideration. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to explore the provider's features and make sure that the theme has a fast load. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, I also recommends using premium and original WordPress themes to optimize SEO and website security reasons. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That way, besides supporting fast loading, themes also support your site more optimally in search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Update to Latest PHP Version</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next way to speed up website loading is to make sure the <strong>PHP version</strong> that the website is using is the latest. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, when you are still using PHP version 5, where the newest version is 7.4. This means that your PHP version is outdated and needs an upgrade. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Migrating from PHP 5 to PHP 7 will positively impact the site as the latest version helps better memory optimization. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To update the PHP version, you can access it via cPanel or going to <strong>WordPress Dashboard &gt;&gt; Updates</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before updating PHP, make sure the plugins and themes you are using support the latest PHP version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Database Optimization</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a lot of activity on the WordPress website, which increases the server workload and makes the database even heavier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from posts in general, there are always spam comments, unused tags, and revised content piled up in the database. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To lighten up your WordPress Website, try using the WP-Rocket plugin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By installing and activating this plugin, you can efficiently <strong>perform regular database cleanin</strong>g to Speed Up WordPress Website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Enabling Gzip Compression</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":3830,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GZIP-Compression-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3830"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enabling Gzip compression</strong> is also best way to Speed Up WordPress Website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can compress files measuring 100MB to 25MB in Zip format files by enabling this feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Activation of Gzip Compression can be done through an optimization plugin like WP-Rocket or manually by adding a line of code in .htaccess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's the script you need to add in <strong>.htaccces</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c&gt;
  # Compress HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Text, XML and fonts
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/vnd.ms-fontobject
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-opentype
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-otf
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-truetype
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-ttf
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/opentype
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/svg+xml
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/x-icon
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml  

  # Remove browser bugs (only needed for ancient browsers)
  BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html
  BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0&#91;678] no-gzip
  BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html
  Header append Vary User-Agent
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To check if the website has Gzip compression enabled, you can test it with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/gzip-test/" target="_blank" aria-label="GiftOfSpeed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">GiftOfSpeed</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Minify CSS, Javascript and HTML</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next step to speed up website loading is to make sure the files on the web are not heavy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure this, you <strong>need to do Minify</strong>, which removes unused characters in the code structure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This minify process can be done on <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong> files. Through Minify, the code file is lighter so that website loading can be faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong><a aria-label="cache plugins (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.waytoidea.com/best-wordpress-caching-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">cache plugins</a></strong> usually includes a minify feature in it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you don't need to use a different plugin if you have optimized the features of the existing cache plugin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Limiting the Amount of Content Per Page</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Displaying <strong>too much content</strong> can be a burden for loading websites. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So instead, try to save on the amount of content and elements you display on the main page or <strong>display with Pagination</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can apply Pagination in the comments, posts, and main pages with lots of content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, on the other hand, this Pagination also prevents the website from wasting bandwidth while improving the user experience due to a more efficient presentation of content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Comment Pagination on a WordPress Website</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's <strong>how to set up Pagination in WordPress comments</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Enter to WordPress dashboard, go to <strong>Settings&gt; Discussions</strong>.</li><li>On the Discussion page, set the maximum number of comments per page and the order in which they appear.</li><li>Scroll down and click <strong>Save Changes</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Content Pagination in WordPress Posts in the Gutenberg Block Editor</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 2 ways we can do in Pagination in posts, manually or automatically. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To manually share content with Gutenberg:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Hover over the area you want to share and click the plus icon.</li><li>Search for "Page Break," then click that option.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to apply Pagination automatically on all pages, you can use the pagination plugin available in WordPress. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-paginate/" target="_blank" aria-label="WP-Paginate (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">WP-Paginate</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pagenavi/" target="_blank" aria-label="WP-PageNavi (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">WP-PageNavi</a></strong>. That way, you can divide the page automatically according to the minimum word limit that you specify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>12. Disable Pingback and Trackback Functions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trackback and Pingback do help websites to be <strong>indexed faster</strong> in search engines. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, on the other hand, this feature is also often used by spammers to get automatic backlinks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, this activity has a tendency to create garbage in the WordPress database. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, the loading of the website is slower. To disable it, try using the <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-xml-rpc-api/" target="_blank" aria-label="Disable XML-RPC Pingback (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Disable XML-RPC Pingback</a></strong> plugin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also deactivate Pingback and Trackbacks manually by going to the <strong>WordPress Dashboard&gt; Settings&gt; Discussions</strong>, then unchecking the Allow Link Notification option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":3822,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Pingback-and-Trackbacks-1024x299.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3822"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>13. Limiting the number of revisions per post</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The revisions that webmasters often make leave the junk in the WordPress database. To minimize this, limiting post revisions will make the WordPress database lighter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do so, you need to open the wp-config file in CPanel or via FTP and add the following code:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5 );</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fill in the number according to the number of revisions you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>14. Avoid Direct Video Uploads, Use Embed URLs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you intend to add videos to website content, <strong>avoid uploading them directly</strong>. Instead, take advantage of the video provider platform's video embed feature and put it in your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this embed feature, videos will appear automatically when published without overloading website performance and waste bandwidth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That way, even though there is quite a lot of video content on the website, you can still speed Up WordPress Website uploading your website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>15. Disable Hotlinks on the Website</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hotlinks may not have a direct impact on website speed. However, disabling it will be one of the optimizations to maintain the speed of your website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason is, this hotlink feature allows users from other websites who access your site's images to steal server bandwidth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, bandwidth becomes wasteful and overwhelming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To disable it, you only need to upload the following file to .<strong>htaccess</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?yourdomain.com &#91;NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?google.com &#91;NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?bing.com &#91;NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?yahoo.com &#91;NC]
RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$ http://dropbox.com/hotlink-placeholder.jpg &#91;NC,R,L]</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>16. Reducing Query Requests</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of database requests to the server certainly affects the website loading speed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, to Speed Up WordPress Website, try to reduce the use of database tables with high queries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are unsure or unsure which database tables can burden the server, you can use the help of plugins. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you can use the <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/" target="_blank" aria-label="Query Monitor plugin (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Query Monitor plugin</a></strong> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/" target="_blank" aria-label="WP-Optimize (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link"><strong>WP-Optimize</strong></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Query Monitor plugin will help you check the database, so you can optimize server performance easily. Or with WP-Optimize, which also has database table optimization options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>17. Minimizing Redirects</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes redirects are done for a specific purpose. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what we need to underline, redirects also make HTTP requests load excessively and slow down website speed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For that, you need to control the flow of content on your website to not generate too many redirects. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also need to reduce links to other pages outside the website if you don't really need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>18. Enable HTTP Keep-Alive</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next trick to Speed Up WordPress Website loading is to <strong>activate HTTP Keep-Alive</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Keep Live method, the website will give orders so that file requests to the server don't repeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To activate it, you can add the following line of code to your <strong>.htaccess</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
 Header set Connection keep-alive
 &lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>19. Removing Query Strings from Static Sources</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next optimization is to remove query strings from static sources, such as Javascript and style sheets. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you need to know that clearing the cache <strong>cannot be done on links containing punctuation "?" and "&amp;"</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The query string prevents the server from caching the website. As a result, the page speed will slow down. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By removing the query string, you can optimize your cache and reduce page loading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can <strong>delete query strings in 2 different ways</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first is to use an optimization plugin such as <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">W3 Total Cache</a></strong> or the <strong><a aria-label="WP Remove Query Strings From Static Resources (opens in a new tab)" href="https://co.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-remove-query-strings-from-static-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">WP Remove Query Strings From Static Resources</a></strong> plugin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for the manual method, you can add the following code in <strong>functions.php</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>function _remove_script_version( $src ){
$parts = explode( '?ver', $src );
return $parts&#91;0];
}
add_filter( 'script_loader_src', '_remove_script_version', 15, 1 );
add_filter( 'style_loader_src', '_remove_script_version', 15, 1 );</code></pre>

<h3>20. Put CSS in the Header and Javascript in the Footer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adjusting the placement of CSS and javascript can also speed up WordPress website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-certification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Javascript</a> is client-side programming run from the client web browser side, not from the web server side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, putting the JS files in the footer will make the webserver load the page first until it's finished, then from the client-side, render the JS file. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this trick, website loading will be faster.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>21. Quality Hosting Service</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last tip for speeding up WordPress website loading is to use the powerful hosting service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you only need a regular server, shared hosting may be sufficient. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if the level of visits is high and requires more resources, maybe it's time to use a VPS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, make sure you use a quality hosting service, both in terms of server quality, features, and service.</p>

<h3>22. Enable Lazy Loading</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least, to Speed up a WordPress website is Lazy Loading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lazy Loading is a technique designed to increase the speed performance of a website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, if a website page contains too many photos and videos, it can immediately decrease the website's performance to be slower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lazy Loading works by delaying loading images or videos. Especially when the visitor is not viewing the photo or video.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, when you visit a website that has 10 types of images. Then Lazy Loading will display only the first image. Other images will be displayed when you scroll down the page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are examples of images before and after Loading by Lazy Loading:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you can already conclude that the Lazy Load function is to reduce the website speed slowdowns. Especially when there are many media attachments (images or videos) on the website itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
