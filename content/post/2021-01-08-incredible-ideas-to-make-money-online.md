<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The internet is an excellent place for new businesses, and it has never been easier to earn side money online than today. Therefore, more and more people follow their dreams and become their own bosses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Idea #1: Custom T-Shirt Printing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening an entire online store and taking care of production and delivery processes takes a lot of time and resources. However, to start <a href="https://printify.com/custom-t-shirts/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">t-shirt</a> printing by using a print on demand platform, all you will need to invest in is promotions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More to it, the production, packaging, storage, and delivery will be taken care of by the print on demand company, so you will be able to develop and grow your business on the time you save.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Idea #2: Take Online Surveys</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are websites like Swagbucks or Toluna that pay you money for taking surveys. This will not help you earn a fortune, but if you have some free time on your hands, it is a great way to earn additional money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you start taking surveys, you will need to add quite some data about yourself and such things as your smoking habits or average income so that the website knows which surveys to assign to you.</p>

<p>Being an influencer is both fun and challenging. It is fun because if you choose a niche that you honestly like, you will be invited to such events and receive such products to review that excite you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2021/01/04/three-important-influencer-marketing-tips-you-should-know/?sh=501b18a31447">being an influencer</a> is also tricky because you need to keep up with consistent content creation and stand out in a crowd of other influencers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A business idea of selling prints of your artwork will not require a lot of investment or time; you need to decide where you will be selling your artwork and how you will advertise.</p>

<h2>Idea #6: Start a Blog</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">start a blog</a>, you will need to decide what topics you are going to write about. Then, you will have to come up with a domain name and start publishing consistent content. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you already have a proper target audience and enough website visitors, there are a few ways to monetize your blog. You can publish guest posts, write paid reviews, use AdSense, create ad banners, or even sell your own merchandise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Idea #7: Become a YouTuber</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since videos are the most popular and the most engaging form of content nowadays, <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-prepare-your-youtube-channel-for-promotion/">starting a YouTube channel</a> sounds promising. Just like blogging, creating videos for YouTube will require specific topics and consistency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you like writing but running a blog is not for you, you could start creating quality content as a freelance writer. To land your first projects, create profiles on websites like Upwork or Simply Hired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, when working with different projects, do not forget to build a portfolio for yourself because most businesses will want to have a look at it before they hire you.&nbsp;</p>
