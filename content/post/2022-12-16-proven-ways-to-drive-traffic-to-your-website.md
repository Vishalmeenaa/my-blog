<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The largest online businesses in the world are built on large amounts of revenue over long periods and not short-term bursts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This requires a consistent strategy, which can only be achieved if you have the proper knowledge. To generate income from your website, you’ll need to find ways to attract traffic and convert traffic on your site. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are seven proven ways to drive qualified traffic to your site. Here are eleven activities you can do to make sure you’re getting the most out of your traffic:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Optimize Your Website For Search Engines </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optimizing your website through search engine optimization (SEO) means ensuring all of the elements on the page are working together in a way that helps visitors find what they came looking for quickly and easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This includes having good titles and descriptions on each page and optimizing the meta tags so Google knows what the page is about. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to optimize your website is by partnering with an <a href="https://clearwateragency.com.au/seo-agency/">SEO agency</a>. These experts can help you ensure your site is optimized from top to bottom so that when someone searches for something related to your business, your site shows up first in their results. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will drive traffic to your site and increase conversions since people who find you through search engines are more interested in what you offer than those who don’t research online before buying something new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Publish Relevant Content </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quality of content on your site matters a lot when it comes to driving traffic – especially if you want that traffic to convert into leads or sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your content isn’t good enough for readers, they won’t return or share it with their friends. So make sure that each piece of content is well-written, engaging, and relevant to people who visit your site so that they’ll keep coming back for more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When publishing relevant content, you must research your target readers’ preferences. For instance, if you’re running an eCommerce store that sells women’s clothing, you should publish articles about trends in women’s fashion and style advice for dressing up for work and going out at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This way, visitors will know what topics are important to them so that they can follow them easily on social media platforms. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Use Social Media Platforms </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also focus on <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/social-media-and-wordpress/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/social-media-and-wordpress/" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving traffic through social media platforms</a> like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These platforms allow you to interact with potential customers and target people who might be interested in what you have to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If done correctly, social media can bring many new visitors to your website. You can use social media to share articles relevant to your niche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will help you establish yourself as an expert in the eyes of others. It can also expose your brand to a broader audience through sharing these articles on your social media accounts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may also use these platforms to reach out to other influencers in your industry and ask them to share some of their content with their followers through their social media accounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will increase your content’s exposure and help build relationships with influencers who can promote your products or services in the future. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Create Email Newsletters  </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/07/28/why-email-marketing-is-still-relevant-in-2022/">Email marketing</a> is another way to drive traffic to your website. You can send out newsletters every week or month with new products or services available on your website and updates about upcoming events. This way, you can update your audience about what’s happening in your business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, you can remind them that they visited your site once before but didn’t make a purchase because they weren’t looking for anything at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, if they came across a product page but didn’t add it to their cart, that’s good information for you because it means they were interested in the product, but there was no urgency for them to take the next step and make a purchase right then and there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So now, when you send them an email with this information, you can convince them that it’s time for them to buy now. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Identify Gaps In Your Industry </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To determine where you should focus your efforts on attracting qualified traffic, you need to identify any gaps in the market that aren’t being addressed by other businesses in your industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, suppose you own a marketing agency but see other companies offering similar services at lower rates than yours. In that case, there’s an opportunity for you to fill this gap by providing better quality products or services at a more affordable price point. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also take advantage of this opportunity by offering more unique features that your competitors don’t provide, such as free consultations or hosting training sessions for prospective customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will allow you to build trust with potential clients and credibility as an industry expert. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>6. Focus On Long-Tail Keywords </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Longer keywords are more specific and less competitive. If you’re targeting a broader keyword, you’ll likely have to compete against the big brands in your industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A long-tail keyword will help you target your audience more effectively than general keywords. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, include synonyms or related words in your content when writing long-tail keywords. You can do this by using <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/best-keyword-research-tools-free-or-paid/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/best-keyword-research-tools-free-or-paid/" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyword research tools</a> like online tool like a keyword planner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This platform will help you identify the best keywords for your business and help improve your website’s overall ranking on search engines. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>7. Start A Podcast </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic/">increase website traffic</a>, a podcast is a great way to do it. Most people need to realize that podcasts are one of the most searched forms of content on the internet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People who listen to podcasts are typically more engaged than those who don’t. They’re also very loyal, so they’ll probably stick around for future episodes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When starting a podcast, you’ll want to ensure that you’re covering topics your audience cares about. You should also consider having guests on your show to build more relationships with your niche’s influencers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>8. Ensure Your Site Is Mobile-Friendly </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to drive qualified traffic to your site successfully, make sure your site is mobile-friendly and <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/speed-up-wordpress-website/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/speed-up-wordpress-website/" rel="noreferrer noopener">optimised for speed</a>. It’ll work with various devices and operating systems, such as iPhones, iPads, Android phones, and tablets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your site isn’t compatible with these devices, it won’t be able to access the internet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make your website mobile-responsive, you can use a responsive design or make every aspect of your site accessible through a single link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use a tool like Google Analytics to see how many people visit your site on different devices and platforms. Using this information, you can ensure that you’re building optimized pages for all types of visitors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>9. Develop Compelling Lead Magnets </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People use search engines to find things and look for answers to questions. If you can make it easy for them to find you through search engines, that's a great way to attract qualified prospects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to do this is with effective lead magnets that provide valuable information about your product or service that people want to learn more about. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can build lead magnets like infographics or eBooks or even provide a free report that provides context around your products or services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also offer discounts or special pricing on products and services in exchange for providing your visitors with access to your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a great way to engage your audience without requiring them to do anything more than read content they're interested in. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>10. Offer A Trial Period </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to generate qualified leads for sales funnel processes, offering free trials of your products or services is an excellent way to do so without spending much money!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This strategy works well when trying to sell software or other digital products because people usually only need to purchase something once they've tried out the product and found it helpful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When offering a free trial period, you must ensure a perceived value is associated with it. For instance, you may provide a free trial of your software as part of your marketing strategy in exchange for feedback on how it works and what improvements could be made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This helps ensure that people are happy with the product and will continue using it after they've been given access to it for free. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>11. Consider Guest Posting </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guest posting is a great way to drive traffic to your website because it allows you to claim your content, which will help build trust with potential clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It also shows that you’re an expert in the industry and can provide valuable information for others looking for similar services or products. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When guest posting, you can share your expertise on a topic related to your business or service. You can also include a link back to your site so that readers know where they can learn more about what you have to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guests can also use their unique voice when writing guest posts and create a unique piece of content that is more engaging than any other blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This helps you stand out from competitors who may be trying to steal your clients by sharing similar ideas as yours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
