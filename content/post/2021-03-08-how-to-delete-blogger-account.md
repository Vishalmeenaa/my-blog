<h2 id="how-to-permanently-delete-wordpress-blog">How to Permanently Delete Wordpress Blog</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How to delete a WordPress website is almost the same as Blogspot. Below is how to delete only the free version of a WordPress website, not WordPress.org or self-hosted WordPress. Here's the complete method:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. log in to&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link"><strong>WordPress.com</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;menu&nbsp;<strong>&gt; General</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Scroll to the bottom and select&nbsp;<strong>Delete your site permanently.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. After that, the option will appear to&nbsp;<strong>export the blog data</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. After exporting, you can immediately delete the blog by pressing&nbsp;<strong>Delete Site</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. Unlike Blogspot, WordPress does not provide an option to restore the blog within a certain time. So once you delete a blog on WordPress, the blog will be gone permanently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 id="it-turns-out-that-my-blog-still-has-traffic">It Turns Out That My Blog Still Has Traffic?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the beginning of the article, it was mentioned that if the blog is no longer generating traffic, it is okay to delete it. So what if it turns out that the blog you left behind for a long time still brings traffic?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deleting the blog isn't the only option. If you feel that your blog's content is still relevant and still driving traffic, you can migrate to your own hosting and use WordPress.org.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is migration? In simple terms, migration is the transfer of data from the old hosting to the new hosting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe you didn't realize that you actually used hosting from a blog provider when you created a blog, both on Blogspot and WordPress.com. In this case, Blogspot and WordPress.com.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, free hosting from Blogspot and WordPress.com has many terms and conditions. There are many limits set, so you cannot be free to be creative. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, on WordPress.com, you can't install plugins, install paid themes, and you can't place AdSense ads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's different if you use WordPress.org. You can determine your own hosting needs, use paid themes, install plugins, install AdSense ads, and various other advantages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you still want to manage blogs with old content with better quality hosting, you can migrate to your own hosting and use WordPress.org. How to?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a Blogspot user and want to move your hosting to your own hosting, you can follow the steps to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://waytoidea.com/import-blogger-to-wordpress/" target="_blank" aria-label="Migrate from Blogger to WordPress without Losing Google Ranking (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Migrate from Blogger to WordPress without Losing Google Ranking</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you want to delete a blog that is not driving any traffic at all. However, if your old blog is still driving traffic, you have two options. </p>
