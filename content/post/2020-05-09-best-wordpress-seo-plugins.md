<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO positioning and organic channels are one of the most important sources of traffic for a website without a doubt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The higher the position of your blog in search engines, the more traffic they receive, and the more its business will grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting a blog or website</a>, our first priority is to install and set up a WordPress SEO plugin for indexing and ranking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An SEO plugin can offer you very powerful features such as audits, content advice, traffic report, performance analysis, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, today we have investigated some of the well-known and powerful <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/wordpress-seo/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress SEO</a> plugins. So let's get to it!</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best WordPress SEO plugins is my recommendation. Even on <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/blog" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waytoidea</a>, I'm using the Rankmath SEO plugin. Its popularity is increasing in recent months and it differs from other ones in that it offers many more features for FREE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rank Math SEO was released at the end of 2018 but is already hot on the heels of major plugins like Yoast SEO. It already has more than 1 million active installations and 4500+ five-star ratings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its free version offers features that you can only access with Yoast or other SEO plugins through the premium plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the features it offers?</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pricing: Free</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They have a FREE option if you want to start using it. A version that offers multiple features that any other plugin would have in its payment option.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you have many websites and also want advice on keywords, content structure, or even use AI to create new ones, feel free to use the PRO version which ranges from $59 to $499 per year.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoast SEO</a> </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6717,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yoast-seo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6717"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the most installed plugin in the WP world with more than 11 million active installations and is responsible for checking and ensuring that your website meets the highest technical and optimization standards to position correctly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of its features allow you to boost the SEO of the entire website and others take care of optimizing individual posts and pages for search engines, which helps in <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boosting website traffic</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, when you are going to create a page or an entry within your site, if you have Yoast SEO activated, it will allow you to make the best decisions within them, both to write correctly and to optimize them technically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has a functionality that allows you to carry out analyzes in which it checks how many times you use the keyword, the length of the text, or the use of an internal link. All this is to be able to optimize the publication or page according to the chosen keyword.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good thing about this plugin is that it not only takes into account quality content but also user experience, which in the end is key to positioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's say that Yoast helps you achieve that balance between offering value to the user and using the right keywords and requirements to optimize the positioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In short, what are the most interesting features?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Divided by pages, posts, and any other custom posts you have in WordPress.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pricing: Free</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are just starting, the best option is to use the free plan, although there is another payment option available from $99 per year that provides you with advanced features such as creating redirects from the plugin.</p>

<h2>Comparison Between Most Complete WordPress SEO Plugins</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surely you are wondering which one to choose or which one is the most complete. We have done an in-depth investigation and here we are going to show you some of the most important differences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Yoast SEO vs Rank Math</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yoast SEO was recently the go-to plugin for WordPress SEO professionals, however, Rank Math is positioning itself as a tough alternative competing against it. And you may ask, how do we compare them?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two plugins are very complete for web positioning tasks both are quite simple, so you will not need much previous experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rank Math will indeed offer you many more options and most importantly for FREE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fundamental aspect such as optimizing keywords has to be in any plugin in this category. In this case, both Yoast and Rank Math offer it in their free version. However, Yoast SEO in its free version, only allows you to optimize the content for one keyword, while Rank Math, in the same version, allows you to do so with up to 5 keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the FREE version of both Yoast and Rank Math provides you with SEO advice about content for its optimization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are already at a more advanced level, you will surely demand more advanced features such as integration with Google Search Console, automatic canonical URLs, and the <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/submit-sitemap-to-google-search-console/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/submit-sitemap-to-google-search-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creation of sitemaps</a>, breadcrumbs, or content structures. We have good news: both plugins offer these features for free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Rank Math allows you to access many more and completely free of charge. For example, internal link analysis, highly performing keyword suggestions, and advanced keyword analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Winner: Rank Math</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Yoast SEO vs All In One SEO</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All In One SEO is another of the most popular. Both are exceptional plugins to optimize your page and SEO positioning strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the nice things about these two plugins is how easy they are to install and configure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Yoast SEO has a more accurate content analysis, and keyword research and SEO rating make it a big difference from All In One.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From experience, let's say that Yoast SEO has much more features for both beginners and experts. And perhaps content analysis is what most helps those professionals who do not have a great deal of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both are similar and although the FREE version is the most suitable for beginners, the most advanced features are only found in its premium version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Winner: Yoast SEO</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your blog is made with WordPress, you can take advantage of one of these plugins to help you optimize your SEO positioning. From content analysis to keyword research to qualifying titles, descriptions, and meta tags.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I have seen, there are a large number of WordPress SEO plugins that's why I also compared the most known SEO plugins, Yoast and Rankmath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a conclusion, I recommend you go with Rank Math SEO plugin as it offers a lot of useful and detailed features for FREE.</p>
