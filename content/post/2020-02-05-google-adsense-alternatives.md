<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we compare Monumetric vs AdSense there is no way to establish precisely which of the two services you can generate more profits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monumetric works with CPM instead of CPC, which means that you will be paid for each impression. If you already know everything about Google AdSense, then you know that the main focus of Google is on clicks and not on content impressions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most interesting thing is that their rates are among the best for CPM campaigns. The income is usually much higher than that of AdSense, so it's a great option to increase your passive income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to use this tool in the future, you should know that the minimum traffic requirement is 10,000 visits per month. Likewise, it has a $99 setup cost for sites that have below 80,000 visits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, you need to be sure that you have the ability to generate enough traffic so that the investment ends up in profit and not a loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To use Monumetric you must meet some basic requirements. Next, we leave you a list of the points that you must meet to monetize with this service.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the popular e-commerce platform couldn't be ruled out. Some bloggers and site owners have long used Amazon's affiliate program as a source of additional income. However, Amazon Native Shopping Ads provide another way to monetize your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this platform, you can embed some contextual ads on your website, and earn commissions for the conversions that are generated from your affiliate links. Google AdSense Alternatives are very varied, and this is one of the best options available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do Amazon Native Shopping Ads work? After adding the Amazon JavaScript code to your site, some products related to the theme you work with will begin to be offered, and for each visitor who clicks on the ads and makes a purchase, Amazon will give you a sales commission.</p>
