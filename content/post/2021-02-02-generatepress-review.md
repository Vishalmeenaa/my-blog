<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find the answer in this article. Come on, see the full discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is GeneratePress Premium?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://generatepress.com/" class="rank-math-link">GeneratePress</a>&nbsp;is a WordPress theme that excels at speed and usability. That's why this theme is made as light and stable as possible so that the website has a maximum performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This theme is a free download. However, to work optimally, GeneratePress released a premium version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, this premium version is what WordPress users want. Apart from being lightweight and stable, the premium theme features are complete for customizing every part of the website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proof? This theme has been downloaded more than 3 million times during six years on the air, with 300,000+ active users!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h-free-vs-premium">GeneratePress Free vs Premium</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>If you can use the free one, why pay?&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you ask like that, the answer will roughly be like the table below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's see the <strong>comparison between Generatepress Premium Vs. Free</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} -->

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very visible difference, right?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The apparent difference, right?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, you can see that the free version features are minimal, and the customization is not flexible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The story is different from the premium version. Complete features that, let alone personal websites, to develop online stores or other&nbsp;blog niches&nbsp;are also competent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why Should You Use GeneratePress Premium?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though it's paid, GeneratePress Premium is still the theme that WordPress residents want. Why? Here are three main reasons why this theme is worth considering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Maximum Performance with Minimal Theme Weight</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GeneratePress carries the jargon of&nbsp;<strong>Light and Responsive</strong>. We can check the truth for ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, one website that uses this theme, namely&nbsp;ma&nbsp;We will check with the two most popular tools for comparison: Google Pagespeed Insight and Gleek Flare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first, with&nbsp;Google Pagespeed Insight, the resulting speed is at a score of 92. It is optimal for websites with many image elements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same thing was also found when checking from&nbsp;Gleek Flare. As a result, the score for website performance reached 94 with loading less than 1 second!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the speed factors for the malaspulang.id website is that the GeneratePress Premium features can be&nbsp;<strong>activated or deactivated</strong>&nbsp;according to the website's needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's why the website can work lighter and faster. Because it only runs individual systems that work. So, website performance is also getting maximal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Website performance is essential because it affects several things, for example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Provides maximum experience for visitors</strong>&nbsp;- According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/increase-speed-of-your-mobile-site-wi/" class="rank-math-link">Google</a>, 53% of visitors will leave a website with loading longer than 3 seconds.</li><li><strong>Increase trust</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" class="rank-math-link">79% of visitors</a>&nbsp;will not return to a slow website.</li><li><strong>Helps rank high on Google</strong>&nbsp;- Speed ​​is one of&nbsp;11 factors&nbsp;that influence Google Ranking.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind that one thing that causes a slow website is to&nbsp;use a "heavy" theme.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, additional elements that are not very useful, such as extra toolbars, lots of sliders, and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more elements, the more complex the programming code, the longer it will take to load.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Ready Support</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help its users, GeneratePress Premium has three support tools. Such as documentation instructions, the official GeneratePress support forum, and support services on WordPress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's discuss them one by one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.generatepress.com/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>documentation assistance</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the form of documents containing instructions, tutorials, and others.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Support Forum</h4>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So you can find and read topics around the question first. Who knows to find a solution and save time, too, right? Hehehe.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. The Most Superior Premium Module</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you still remember what&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgWZyE5shZcz1KFLSmPcOw86KxseI0vrGbEN0OIkjj8/edit#heading=h.v9vq8oo62atq" class="rank-math-link">features are in the premium theme</a>? Now is the time to discuss one by one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, before going any further, please note that the GeneratePress Premium theme features are called&nbsp;<strong>modules</strong>. This module can be activated and deactivated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it's time for us to dive deeper into each module. Come on, come on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. Site Library</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Site Library is a&nbsp;<strong>collection of website theme demos</strong>&nbsp;that can be selected as needed. A website demo is a ready-to-use theme layout that can be imported onto your website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This demo collection is divided into three according to the type of editor used. Some use&nbsp;the standard WordPress editor,&nbsp;Elementor, or Beaver Builder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. Colors</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name implies, you can set 60 color options on your website. To do this, go to&nbsp;<strong>Appearance</strong>&nbsp;&gt; select Colors and&nbsp;<strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Customize</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Colors</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The image on the right is the parts you can customize.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if you want to adjust the color on the&nbsp;<strong>website's Body</strong>, you will be given coloring options in the image on the left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This module is handy for those who want to build business&nbsp;branding&nbsp;because you can set the dominant color or other colors on each corner of the website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In full, you can&nbsp;<strong>adjust the color to the smallest part on</strong>&nbsp;your&nbsp;<strong>website</strong>. For example, a different color between links has not been clicked on by visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Typography</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the free version, you will only find a few font choices with minimal settings. It's different in premium themes, which provide more complete setup options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The setting is comfortable, namely, go to&nbsp;<strong>Appearance</strong>&nbsp;&gt; select Typography and&nbsp;<strong>Activate</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Customize</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next select&nbsp;<strong>Typography</strong>, and you can edit the typography in the sections of the website below. Unmitigated, there are a total of 70 parts that you can adjust the typography!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feel free to experiment when setting up typography—for example, font selection, font combination, font size, layout, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. Elements</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>You have chosen one of the demos in the site library, but how come it seems that something is missing?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With module elements, you can&nbsp;<strong>edit the layout of</strong>&nbsp;your&nbsp;<strong>website</strong>&nbsp;as desired. For example, you are adding a hero page, setting the header, sidebar, footer, CTA, and so on. No limits!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's straightforward, and please go to the menu&nbsp;<strong>Appearance</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Add New Element</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's more, there are GP Hooks tools. You can insert elements into any area of ​​your website without messing with the core code or the whole code.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, the post before the header below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it is a regular theme, it needs custom HTML and CSS specifically. However, with GeneratePress Premium, you can input code to specify the WordPress editor's display location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. WooCommerce</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WooCommerce is the best&nbsp;<strong>free online shop plugin</strong>&nbsp;on WordPress. The features of WooCommerce are complete for an online store class.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, managing products, orders, coupons, discounts, store address settings, and&nbsp;various other benefits for online businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you are a GeneratePress Premium user, you can practically activate this PluginPlugin! Just click&nbsp;<strong>Appearance</strong>&nbsp;&gt; select&nbsp;<strong>WooCommerce</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Activate</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, you can customize your online shop by selecting&nbsp;<strong>the WooCommerce option</strong>&nbsp;on the screen's left side or clicking&nbsp;<strong>the Shop menu</strong>&nbsp;in the visual editor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WooCommerce customization is also effortless because GeneratePress Premium allows you to see a live preview after clicking. Like the example below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>6. Menu Plus</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MenuMenu Plus module allows you to&nbsp;<strong>create custom navigation</strong>. For example, sticky navigation, off-canvas panel, and so on. Like the off-canvas panel example below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For customization, all options are complete in the&nbsp;<strong>Layout</strong>&nbsp;menu, with easy settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, make sure other modules like Colors, Spacing, and Typography are also active, yes, because they are used together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>7. Spacing</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you build a website with&nbsp;HTML, you will often encounter spacing settings. Such as adjusting&nbsp;<strong>the element size, padding, and margins</strong>&nbsp;for each element.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edits that won't happen if you use the GeneratePress Premium theme. Because there is a Spacing module so that settings can be done more quickly, without coding.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Activate the&nbsp;<strong>Spacing</strong>&nbsp;module first. The method is the same as activating other modules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, select the&nbsp;<strong>Layout</strong>&nbsp;option &gt; select the element you want to edit, for example, the&nbsp;<strong>Container</strong>&nbsp;option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This module helps you build a website that is authentic and different from the others.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>8. Blog</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to have a stunning blog appearance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What can you do?&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you want to hide or show posts, featured image settings, locations, infinite scrolling, even things as simple as column settings, and many others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>9. Secondary Navigation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not enough primary Menu? Relax, you can add to the secondary MenuMenu.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This monument serves to&nbsp;<strong>expand website activity</strong>&nbsp;that sides but very important. For example, the login/logout form, My Account, shopping cart for online stores, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This module must be activated in conjunction with the Colors, Spacing, and Typography modules. You can freely adjust the secondary MenuMenu. For example, menu width, layout, menu location, fonts, colors, and so on.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to use a photo on a website background? You really can!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you have activated the background module, you can set it in&nbsp;<strong>Customize</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Background Images</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the free version, you can only provide a photo background on the Body of the website. For premium, which background can be edited?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above are the parts that can be set in the background, from header to footer. You can set size, position, scroll style, and more. Wow, it's so complete!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>11. Sections</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have you ever seen a display like this on a single website page?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the sections above are sections. The characteristics that can be caught by the eye are the presence of several points that gather on a website page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, this page is very suitable for the&nbsp;homepage&nbsp;or&nbsp;landing page&nbsp;because it looks neat and distinctive. Options like this are very rarely found on other website themes, especially free ones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, it seems that coding is quite complicated, huh? Edits, let us tell the secret.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>12. Disable Elements</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This module is arguably the <a href="https://waytoidea.com/best-wordpress-caching-plugins/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">key to the speed</a> of the GeneratePress Premium theme.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If on a page there are elements that you do not need or want to remove, you can disable those elements. So, you can get the look you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This point also makes loading on your website page faster. Because it only displays useful elements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several elements can be disabled, as shown below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>13. Copyright</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the very bottom of a website, have you ever seen something like this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, that's copyright. It is usually located at the very end of a footer. Well, this article shows whether a website is valid or not.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you use a free theme, you will not be able to edit the copyright because you don't have a license to use the theme.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a different story if you use GeneratePress Premium, you can activate the Copyright module. Then arrange it in&nbsp;<strong>layout</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Footer</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Copyright</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
