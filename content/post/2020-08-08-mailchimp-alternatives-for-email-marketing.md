<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Price</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sendinblue offers a limited free plan, which is more generous than Mailchimp's free plan.&nbsp;Mailchimp's free plan allows you to send 10,000 emails to up to 2,000 contacts a month, while Sendinblue allows you to send 300 emails a day to unlimited contacts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>limit</td><td>Sendinblue free</td><td>Mailchimp free</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly email</td><td>About 9,000</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Contact person</td><td>unlimited</td><td>2,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Sendinblue also provides many advanced plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Why choose Mailinmp instead of Sendinblue?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the functionality provided by Sendinblue is similar to that of Mailchimp, there are key differences between the packages provided.&nbsp;The main benefit of choosing Sendinblue on Mailinmp is that there is no limit to the number of contacts in the mailing list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With SendinBlue, whether you have registered for a premium customized enterprise plan or just use the free platform, you can still have an unlimited number of contacts in your mailing list.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, all Mailchimp plans limit the number of contacts that your mailing list can include.&nbsp;This makes SendinBlue one of the best Mailchimp alternatives for people with large email lists or those who are worried about being punished for rapidly growing their email lists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Why choose ConvertKit instead of Mailchimp?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main selling point of ConvertKit is its friendly user interface.&nbsp;Using a simple interface, you can easily group contact lists, intuitively create automatic workflows, design email sequences, etc. without causing any trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, although Mailchimp has a lot of features, many of them are not so easy to navigate and therefore will definitely not be considered intuitive.&nbsp;If you are looking for an easy-to-use product, it is ConvertKit.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, Mailchimp's mid-range plan only allows 3 to 5 users.&nbsp;For those who are looking for team tools, this makes ActiveCampaign a better choice.</p>
