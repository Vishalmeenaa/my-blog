<h2>Is It Possible to Share YouTube Videos on Instagram Stories or Post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it is absolutely possible, provided you follow some important steps religiously. There is no native process of doing this. You just need to download the YouTube video on your phone and then simply upload it on the Instagram channel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet another thing you must keep in mind is that there is a major reason why YouTube does not have any native feature for helping out the users. There are copyright reasons why YouTube does not allow general people to download videos from its site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the reason why before re-uploading any kind of copyrighted material, it is important for you to ensure you are allowed to do so by the owner of the video. Also, credit the person who has posted the visual content in your post so people can easily get back to the original source of the video.</p>
