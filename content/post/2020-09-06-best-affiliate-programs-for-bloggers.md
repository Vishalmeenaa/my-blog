<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are Affiliate Programs?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Affiliate programs are agreements where an online merchant selling products pays an affiliate website a commission for any sales generated through referral traffic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The affiliate site places affiliate links pointing to the merchant’s site to track transactions. Every partnership agreement between a seller and an affiliate has commission rates and payout information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three leading players in the process:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Seller. For example, a retailer selling goods.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Partner. For example, a partner website with links to products in reviews.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A visitor who visits an affiliate site clicks the affiliate link on the seller’s website and buys the product.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Join Affiliate Programs?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two types of programs: self-linking merchant programs and affiliate network programs.<br>The companies’ websites run programs with their software. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can join them by searching for “Brand + Affiliate Program or Affiliate,” finding your program page, and filling out the application form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program can also be located in partner networks where groups of sellers offer their links in one safe place. Networks like these allow you to join new programs in different topics, view payout reports, and get affiliate links to add to your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some programs accept everyone; some automatically add users who have reached specific parameters. Many programs require a Partner Account Manager to review your application manually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What are the requirements for participating in affiliate programs?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To participate in affiliate programs, you need a website and a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">PayPal account</a>&nbsp;or bank account.&nbsp;In some cases, you can work without a website by promoting referral links on social media.&nbsp;This is fine for social media influencers, but I always recommend having your website or blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Design a website efficiently with an SSL certificate for HTTPS installed.&nbsp;Better if your email address is connected to your domain.&nbsp;Remember to set up your PayPal account to accept funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What Are The Best Affiliate Programs?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Web hosting is one of the most popular affiliate marketing categories in the world.&nbsp;Hosting is required for every new site.&nbsp;This is why most of the affiliates who write about marketing, starting an online business, or blogging end up using web hosting affiliate programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key to effectively recommending a web hosting platform is that you must be very familiar with the tool.&nbsp;Do not choose a program based on the amount of payments only.&nbsp;Without a doubt, the platform should be intuitive, feature-rich, and the best recommendation for your audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Web hosting companies provide some of the best affiliate programs, which is why they are # 1 on my list.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>What Does Regular Affiliate Payment Mean?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your recommended customer is a recurring paying customer, you will receive multiple payments.&nbsp;Recurring income services pay commissions monthly to retain customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most recurring paid programs are platforms that require a monthly subscription, usually software advertisers (SaaS).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":5835,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image" id="attachment_5835"><img src="https://otdyhsamostoyatelno.ru/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezhemesyachni_dohod.jpg" alt="Monthly income - how to make money on a blog" class="wp-image-5835"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.datapine.com/blog/monthly-recurring-revenue/" target="_blank">datapine.com</a></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With monthly subscriptions, the customer cost (LTV) is much higher than the one-time sale cost as customers continue to pay each month for a long time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows the advertiser to afford to pay the affiliate in one of two ways: a one-time commission in excess of the monthly cost, or a recurring percentage over the customer's payment period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Affiliates love both one-time payments and regular payments, and each approach has its own pros and cons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>One-time payments</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;You get a substantial payout, sometimes up to 800% of the monthly subscription price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;You will earn less than with a regular payment if the client has been using the service for many years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Standing commission</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;You get a steady income every month and you know how much money you will make.&nbsp;Plus, you can make more money if you have low bounce rates and high retention rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;You receive a lower amount immediately, and the client can refuse to renew the use of the service.&nbsp;In this case, you will earn much less than the possible one-time payment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>VPN Affiliate Programs</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Most recently, residents of Belarus began to use these services in large quantities, when the state restricted visits to various Internet resources.</p>

<h2><strong>Pinterest Affiliate Programs</strong></h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of May 2017, marketers can post affiliate links directly to their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinterest</a>&nbsp;Pins&nbsp;, not just their blogs.&nbsp;This innovation led to the possibility of making money online with Pinterest without a website or blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has enabled fashion, beauty and lifestyle influencers to reach 200 million Pinterest users more effectively.&nbsp;With&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">29% of adults using Pinterest&nbsp;and 93% of p</a>inners claiming to use Pinterest to plan purchases, this is a profitable way to generate affiliate income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best strategy is to join an affiliate network with products that match the needs of people on Pinterest.&nbsp;Popular categories on Pinterest include food and drink, home decor, fashion, health and fitness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some programs you can connect to Pinterest:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Amazon Associates</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sell ​​any Amazon product directly through your Pinterest contacts.&nbsp;You can earn up to 10% on millions of products.&nbsp;The company helps to place links and promote products on your website using banners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit is that when you link to a product using an Amazon affiliate link, you get credits for any product that the user adds to their cart after clicking on your referral link.&nbsp;If a user adds an item to their cart and it stays there, you receive a commission for up to 90 days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eBay affiliate network takes a similar approach and you can promote over 1.1 billion ads through affiliate links.&nbsp;With eBay, you can earn 50% to 70% of the sale price.&nbsp;However, you only earn income when a user makes a purchase within 24 hours of visiting eBay.</p>

<h2>What to Look for in High Paid Affiliate Programs?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first two things to look out for are commissions and average order value (AOV).&nbsp;Remember, high commission rates x high average order value = more affiliate income.&nbsp;Next, take a look at the cookie duration and potential profit per click (EPC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look for the following options in the best high-paying programs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Commission</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The percentage of sales that the advertiser finances to the partner for attracting a new customer.&nbsp;This percentage can vary from a few to 60% and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Average order value (AOV)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Average dollar amount spent each time a customer pays for a purchase.&nbsp;To calculate AOV, divide your total revenue by the number of orders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Average earnings per click (EPC)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The income that the partner receives for each click on the advertiser's website using the affiliate link.&nbsp;Usually EPC calculates the amount of revenue per 100 clicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Cookie expiration date</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cookie is a piece of text that is stored on a visitor's device and used to track affiliate sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duration is the length of time that the cookie remains on the computer after clicking on the affiliate link.&nbsp;For example, a 30-day cookie duration means that if a user clicks on an affiliate link and makes a purchase within 30 days, the affiliate receives a commission on the sale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should be promoting affiliate products from companies that pay either on sales or on clicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last metric to look out for is the long duration of the cookie.&nbsp;Usually the cookie duration is 1 month.&nbsp;You can find programs ranging in duration from a few days to 100+ days.&nbsp;I recommend programs that have longer lasting cookies as a standard feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you want high payouts, high AOV, and long lasting cookies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Affiliate Marketing Tips</h2>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Affiliate marketers are not advised to blindly recommend any product just because of their high affiliate payouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Promote products you know, love, and understand</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Netizens want to learn from real-world experiences and quickly find false recommendations.&nbsp;Therefore, it is important to share your real product reviews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Track current affiliate products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow the trends for affiliate products in relevant areas:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, we discussed what to look for in the best high-paying affiliate programs (affiliate programs) + identified new trends in this industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do I find these programs?&nbsp;Hint:&nbsp;<strong>affiliate networks</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Affiliate Networks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can go to Google and search for individual affiliate programs, search for hours and end up finding ones that match your interests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is much faster to join an affiliate network where you can view thousands of programs in one place.&nbsp;When you search for a specific topic, you'll see affiliate commissions, cookie durations, EPC averages, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What are affiliate networks?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Affiliate networks are intermediaries between product sellers and partners who promote them.&nbsp;Collaboration benefits both sellers and partners.&nbsp;Affiliate networks enable partners to search among sellers (advertisers) in one place.&nbsp;In addition, they allow sellers to reach a large audience and promote their products and services among all partners in the network.&nbsp;You can compare commissions on different products, receive payments and&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://raventools.com/blog/adding-affiliate-links/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">track all affiliate links</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How to choose the best one?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of an affiliate network ultimately depends on your overall strategy and the products you want to promote.&nbsp;You need to choose the products that fit your niche and generate the most revenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I recommend to pay attention to when choosing to work with affiliate networks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. A large number of sellers in your niche</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some networks specialize in specific topics.&nbsp;If you're a blogger, make sure there are a large number of sellers online that are relevant to your niche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. Make sure the network is 100% free</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't have to pay money to access the affiliate network.&nbsp;Networks make money by charging sellers fees - service fees, monthly fees, or a percentage of affiliate income.&nbsp;If you find a network that charges money to join, opt out of that collaboration.&nbsp;All major networks are free for partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Sellers who pay a lot</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you find an affiliate network with sellers that match your niche, make sure you can get high commissions on your sales.&nbsp;Remember that average affiliate commissions (depending on the topic) range&nbsp;<a href="https://monitorbacklinks.com/blog/affiliate/average-affiliate-commission-rates" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">from 5% to 30%</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;To maximize your income by looking at the list of sellers, calculate potential income figures based on product prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. High level of customer support</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All networks provide some level of support.&nbsp;If you need 24/7 support via email or live chat, check out the platform descriptions and reviews to find the best and most suitable one for you.</p>

<h2>What Are The Best Affiliate Networks?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you know what to look for when choosing, consider the best affiliate networks I recommend joining this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1.&nbsp;Shareasale</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shareasale is a large affiliate network with over 3900 merchants and over 1 million partners.&nbsp;The company is a leader in the industry.&nbsp;Main topics: fashion, interior and landscaping, food and drinks, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the network shares lessons on how to make money with affiliate marketing, training webinars, recommendations for sellers and marketing tools to help you increase your income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6497} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://otdyhsamostoyatelno.ru/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shareasale_partnerskaya_programma.jpg" alt="shareasale affiliate programs" class="wp-image-6497"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This platform is technologically reliable.&nbsp;In particular, the Shareasale platform provides easy access to affiliate links, reporting tools, and prides itself on its transparency, accuracy, speed and efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are just starting out and want to have fun with affiliate marketing, I recommend&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.shareasale.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">joining Shareasale</a>&nbsp;as an affiliate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you are a seller looking for partners to promote your products, you can also register as a seller on this network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2.CJ</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cj.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">CJ</a>&nbsp;(formerly Commission Junction) is an affiliate network that conducts $ 15 billion in payments through its platform, with $ 1.8 billion paid out annually to their partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to partner with the world's largest brands, become a CJ partner.&nbsp;Priceline, GoPro are just a few of the sellers you can partner with on CJ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6498} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://otdyhsamostoyatelno.ru/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cj_partnerskaya_programma.jpg" alt="cj affiliate program" class="wp-image-6498"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As partners, they work with major brands such as CNN, Time, Digg and Buzzfeed.&nbsp;With this competition, one of the downsides is that it can be difficult for new partners to get approval to work with large sellers.&nbsp;You have to get creative with the&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://blog.pandadoc.com/cold-email-strategy-that-converts-with-expert-tips-and-templates/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">outreach letter</a>&nbsp;writing job&nbsp;to be successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Free and easy setup, informative reports, and reliable monthly payments are why CJ is a great platform to work with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Rakuten</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://rakutenadvertising.com/publishers/affiliate/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">Rakuten</a>&nbsp;is an affiliate network that has been in the business for 24 years.&nbsp;However, they are not as big as Conversant's CJ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are about 1,000 registered merchants on the network, including many well-known brands such as New Balance, Ray-Ban and Sephora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What makes the network special?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Rakuten has a very intuitive user interface, advanced linking tools, and the ability to create changing banners when promoting products.&nbsp;Setting up is very simple.&nbsp;Plus, they have transaction reports and instructional videos to help you get started and maximize your income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6499} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://otdyhsamostoyatelno.ru/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rakuten.jpg" alt="rakuten" class="wp-image-6499"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main drawback is, perhaps, that there are not many sellers on the network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, they have irregular payment schedules, so you can't get paid at the same time every month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a partner who has already joined the larger platforms and want to expand your list of sellers, join the Rakuten network as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other good affiliate networks include&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.impact.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Impact</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.awin.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Awin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.clickbank.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Clickbank</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;If you're in the B2C consumer goods niche, try Clickbank, a marketplace for promoting products from a wide range of industries such as food, health, fitness, nutrition, interior design and more.</p>
