<h2>Work on Your Search Engine Optimization Plan</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a never-ending job. It’s a well-known fact that having a<a href="https://backlinko.com/seo-strategy"> proper SEO plan</a> can be an excellent way to put your brand in front of your customers. It should be an essential part of your marketing strategy in 2023 as it can attract prospects to your website, which translates into increased revenue for your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has been an important part of digital marketing for an incredibly long time and seeing its effects, it is only becoming more and more important as time goes by. <br><br>Working with content in the form of text, images, and video but also with the technical aspect is very important if you are looking to stay up to date and give your visitors the right content at the right time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The business value of SEO is obvious, but how do you boost your SEO marketing strategy, you might wonder. The most important thing is to think of quality and quantity and invest in good content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-write-seo-friendly-content/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-write-seo-friendly-content/" rel="noreferrer noopener">write search engine-friendly content</a> and keep track of how it ranks. Text content with enough words will rank higher on SERPs. Keywords describe what the website contains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you use specific keywords in the site hierarchy—titles, headlines, body text, and alt text—users will find the site when they browse using those terms. It’s also important to keep in mind meta descriptions and titles. They describe to the visitor what the website is about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, be sure to write website content for people, not search engines. Make sure that the text is easy to read and that you use enough keywords. Something you should avoid is "keyword stuffing," which Google can perceive as spam.</p>

<h2>Get a Greater Number of Email List Subscriptions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2023, email marketing will still be relevant. In fact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/why-marketers-should-keep-sending-you-emails">email is nearly 40 times more effective</a> at acquiring customers than social media. So, growing your email list should be one of your top priorities this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The great thing about email lists is that there are plenty of ways to ensure that you can get new subscribers consistently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, you could consider using an<a href="https://www.justuno.com/blog/the-best-examples-of-email-popup-designs-and-why-they-work/"> email pop up</a> form on your website that will encourage your visitors to sign up. To get them to sign up, you can create an appealing message or even offer an incentive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will help you develop a new type of communication that you can leverage to draw in new customers and nurture and convert them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to take the pop-up design into account and think about how it can help you attract new leads, drive more sales, and boost growth. To make the idea of signing up more appealing, you can offer a discount or a freebie to visitors who leave their email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure to disclose what exactly they will receive so that you can increase the chances of them opening your emails and taking the action you want them to.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By now, we all know that social media is one of the most powerful ways to reach and professionally interact with your target audience while giving it a personal touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing to do when using social media is to always provide accurate information about your company and keep visitors updated about your activities, latest products, services, and sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, you should make sure your content is engaging, useful, and entertaining to help drive traffic and keep your existing and prospective customers on their toes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to Instagram and Facebook, you should try to explore new platforms that may have been overlooked. Analyze what did not work last year and try something different in 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, you should think about leveraging LinkedIn, as it’s an excellent social network for businesses to share relevant information, valuable contacts, and events that can boost your marketing efforts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By opening a company profile and learning<a href="https://www.linkedhelper.com/blog/how-to-really-use-linkedin-effectively-for-business-top-guide-for-all-occasions/"> how to use LinkedIn effectively for business</a>, you’ll be perceived as a professional and authority in your industry and connect with other reputable organizations and people who might be interested in your products or services.</p>

<h2>Identify Important KPIs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YRbmRZTRarOhh2TO45oW7iwlkO3YJGla_gdtFOSeL6yzVN_lO_UYboa_No2PIQM8TsRpLE8Djv8SGN9ZvUL0Uf5Q09hHVpIEMCTnkjdZh7rT-Rnro7wW5eImpju6kvDO5SVoE4sb-szpejlfBFNaqrQ" width="386" height="579"><br>Image source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@jack-sparrow/">Jack Sparrow</a> from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-sitting-beside-man-standing-in-brown-long-sleeve-shirt-5918200/">Pexels</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KPI is short for key performance indicator and is a measurable value that reflects how efficiently a company is meeting its key business objectives. The purpose of setting up<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-key-performance-indicators"> KPIs in marketing</a> is to measure the progress and success of your marketing initiatives. The KPI can then act as a compass to navigate market activities and influence how they change over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clear and relevant KPIs also make it easy for you to demonstrate what business benefit you contribute to the company or what standard you can offer and maintain toward customers. With solid numbers to lean on, you can both gain trust and increase the chance of more resources for your marketing department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defining the right KPIs is not a one-man project, but a work that should involve more people. First, because the KPIs will most likely affect more people than you. And secondly, to let others contribute with their knowledge and experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every company is different so the management and marketing department should therefore create a unique set of short- and long-term KPIs tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get started, some of the KPIs you should consider tracking include sales revenue, the number of high-quality leads generated, cost per acquisition, and so on.</p>

<h2>Analyze Your Competitors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most companies tend to carry out competitive analysis, but usually it comes down to keeping an eye on what they’re up to from afar. If you want to always remain one step ahead, you have to delve deeper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comparing your and your competitor's products or services is perhaps the most important part of the entire competitor analysis. By placing the products side by side, you can more easily find out what differentiates them and what can be improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since you want the comparison to be clear, it can be good to use a<a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/competitive-matrix"> comparison matrix</a>. Apart from the different characteristics of the products or services, the comparison should include information on pricing, quality, ease of use, service, guarantees, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget to review the customers' reviews (if available). This way, you can more easily understand how they perceive both your and competitors' products or services. However, remember to only use reviews from credible sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also tap into your top existing customers and ask them what they believe to be the real differences between your offer and one of your competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They will appreciate your concern and you’ll be able to get real-time feedback on how you can improve your products or services to meet their needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, it can help you gain a better understanding of your customers, allowing you to tailor your marketing efforts to them.</p>
