<h2>Benefits of SEO Tools</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already <a href="https://waytoidea.com/what-is-seo-search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" aria-label="know SEO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">know SEO</a> is necessary, the benefits are many, then how to do SEO effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many ways, but one of them to fast-track to master SEO is to use SEO Tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools are tools specifically used to help bloggers do SEO more efficiently and generate better organic traffic to blogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From experience, here are the benefits of having SEO Tools, as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Site Audit</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is the SEO problem on the blog site? Why is the traffic stagnant or even down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quickest way to spot problems on your blog is to do a site audit on SEO Tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All you have to do is enter the URL address in SEO Tools which will automatically audit the site. The system will check all pages and site structure in SEO Tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The results of the site audit include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Issues or problems found on blogs.</li><li>The severity of each issue.</li><li>Provided details of the issue and how to solve it.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Site audits can be made to be carried out regularly at predetermined time intervals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So automatically, SEO Tools will check the health level of your site's SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Keyword Research</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which keywords will be targeted in the content?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Searching on search engines uses keywords as triggers. The search engine will perform searches based on user-written keyword queries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engines will see if the keywords you are looking for are in the content of your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, keywords are very important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem is whether to write, for example, the keyword 'Unsecured Credit' in an article about&nbsp;unsecured loans?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's a practical problem that you always face when writing content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword selection is crucial in building SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools helps by providing following <strong>information related to keywords</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Keyword Search Volume</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How significant is the number of searches for these keywords? The higher the search volume for a keyword, the more potential traffic you will get.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is futile to write a topic of writing with keywords that do not exist for the search.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Keyword Competition</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Competition in SEO, for one thing, is determined by competition on keywords. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is essential to know how tight the competition is in the keywords you are aiming for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have to consider and measure your SEO skills. For those of you who are still in the learning process, please optimize keywords with a low level of competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Keyword Ideas</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This part is what I like the most. SEO Tools provides new keyword ideas that I may not know yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In SEO Tools, it provides derived keyword features taken from the keywords I input, and then other related keywords are provided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many keywords that I didn't think about before, now the idea appears, after reading the derived keywords from SEO Tools. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derived keywords can increase the potential for traffic we receive from the main keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Number of Backlinks and Referring Domains</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the factors that affect SEO is the number of domains or backlinks on a site.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ahrefs, a well-known SEO Tools provider, once conducted research and found that the number of referring domains on a website was positively related to the website's ranking on search engines. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more referring domains, the higher the ranking in the search engines and eventually, the more significant the traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools provides complete information about <strong>backlinks</strong> and <strong>referring domains</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Referring Domains</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Domains and Backlinks that link to our site. Both the new link and the missing link. The data is updated every day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In SEO Tools, I can monitor the development of the number of referring domains and backlinks regularly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If they drop, I can know from which links and, if increased, know what links contributed to the addition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Backlinks Quality</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Quality backlinks</strong> that link to the site. It is very important to make sure that the links are from other sites of good quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools have DA/PA or DR/PR indicators to measure the quality of a link and Domain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By knowing the quality of a site, I can plan what sites to collaborate with.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if I get a link from a spam site, I can disavow or request to remove the link from the site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Competitor's Backlinks Info</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools provide information about competitors, what links to use, and how much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This information can be an inspiration to build backlinks, especially if the site you are building is new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Competitor Analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scramble for ranking #1 in search engines is heavily influenced by competition. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rank position changes dynamically with the activities of each competitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In SEO, you must know who the competitors are, whether the competitor's website is more robust, more authoritative, or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because if a stronger website occupies the target keyword, you should change it to a lighter competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools provide fairly complete competitor analysis. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you will know competitors' info about the amount of traffic, keywords targeted, the backlinks they have, and other information. Here's epic guide on <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-simple-but-effective-guide-to-keyword-competition-analysis/" target="_blank" aria-label="SEO Competitor Analysis (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">SEO Competitor Analysis</a> by Neil Patel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Content Analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content is one of the most important keys to the success of SEO. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google says that website owners must focus on the best content, where the content that many people are looking for will automatically rank highest on search engine pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SEO Tools provides content analysis</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Popular topics based on various criteria, for example, country, number of searches, CPC</li><li>Popular sites that contain your targeted content. Can find out how the content of the site is ranked</li><li>New topics that are developing, which can be an inspiration for writing content.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference between content analysis and keywords is that content analysis focuses on sites that contain related content, while keywords are only on keywords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Ranking Position</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You must know the position of the site's ranking on each keyword. The higher the ranking position, the more traffic will flow to the site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO Tools provide information on all the keywords that are ranking on the site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This information is beneficial because</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The more keywords that are ranked, the greater the traffic comes. Conversely, if the keyword ranking trend drops, you can immediately check what the problem is.</li><li>Opportunities in keywords that are already ranked but still in a lower position. Optimization of the page can be done to improve its position.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I often see that a decrease in traffic begins with a decrease in the number of keywords on the ranking site from experience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conversely, the increase in traffic is indicated by the more ranking web pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the number of keywords ranked in search engines is important to know whether or not an SEO strategy is healthy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can it be done by yourself, manually, without the help of tools? Yes, but not practical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It takes time time-consuming to check keywords and rankings in search engines. And the manual method is not necessarily accurate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the site grows, the more content, it is almost impossible for you to check the keywords one by one at a time. Not efficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So learned about benefits of SEO tools, time to dive in best SEO Tools.</p>
