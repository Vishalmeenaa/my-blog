<p>After starting your blog, it’s time to learn WordPress SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be successful on the web, you need to understand how to use search engine optimization in WordPress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reports say&nbsp;<a href="https://wpdevshed.com/wordpress-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress has a 43% market share</a>&nbsp;and WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems on the internet. With it, you can make any type of website or blog you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why we have come up with a comprehensive guide on WordPress SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing to understand about search engine optimization (SEO) for your website is that it’s about making your site as visible as possible in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article will take you through the WordPress SEO basics and explain the different ways you can optimize your WordPress site for better rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-seo">What is SEO?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is the process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that your WordPress site can appear higher up on the list, leading to increased traffic and conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO combines many strategies such as content marketing, keyword research, and backlinking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three main aspects of SEO: on-page optimization, off-page optimization, and technical optimization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>On-page SEO involves improving the content quality and relevance of a website’s web pages to better match what the user is searching for.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Off-page SEO refers to activities that are outside of a web page’s control that can affect its ranking in search engines.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Technical SEO refers to making sure that your website is set up in such a way that it will be indexed by search engines.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-seo-important">Why is SEO important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is essential for any business, as it can help you attract new customers and improve your overall online presence. Additionally, SEO can also lead to increased revenue through the sale of advertising space on your site or the inclusion of affiliate links.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A search engine ranks your website by identifying how well it matches a particular keyword. If your website is optimized for that keyword, it will appear higher in the results. The search engine will then rank that page higher, and its ranking on the SERP will increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is also an important aspect of marketing because it helps your website stand out from other sites with similar content or keywords. In addition, SEO services can help you track which pages are likely to be most successful in terms of traffic and conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While understanding the theoretical aspects of SEO is crucial, practical application often requires a nuanced approach that comes with experience. For businesses or individuals looking to navigate the complexities of SEO, especially in a competitive market like India, seeking guidance from a seasoned professional can make all the difference. Kunal Dabi is one such&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kunaldabi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO consultant in India</a>&nbsp;who has consistently demonstrated the ability to elevate websites in search rankings, ensuring they not only stand out but also achieve their desired conversion goals.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into WordPress SEO basics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="check-your-site-health">Check your site health</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Check you’re Using Suitable Hosting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most important factors for your website to rank well in search engines is hosting. If you are not using suitable hosting, you might experience slow loading speeds and even downtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hosting can have a huge impact on your website’s performance and SEO. Good hosting will help you rank higher in search engines and be more responsive to your visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best WordPress hosting providers offer scalable infrastructure, fast page load times, security features, and 24/7 support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Upgrade to PHP 7.0 or higher</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latest version of WordPress includes improved support for PHP 7.0 or higher, which is required for some features to work correctly in WordPress 5.0+.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upgrade to PHP 7.0 or higher in order to take advantage of the new features that come with this release and improve your site’s performance!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make Sure You’re using SSL and HTTPS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The majority of people are using the internet for shopping, banking, and communicating with friends and family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This shift has also led to an increase in cyber attacks on websites. These attacks can be devastating to a company’s reputation, revenue, and customer base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it’s important to take steps to protect your website from these attacks by implementing SSL/HTTPS protocol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="check-your-site-settings">Check Your Site Settings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Ensure that all Posts are Assigned Categories</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Categories help search engines better understand what topics are covered on your site and organize your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-ensure-that-all-posts-have-tags">2. Ensure that all Posts Have Tags</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tags can be used to categorize different types of articles, such as blog posts or page templates – they’re an excellent way of helping search engines understand the diversity on your site without having to use categories for every post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-make-sure-you-ve-got-no-blank-pages-in-any-aategory-or-tag-set">3. Make sure you’ve got no blank pages in any aategory or tag set</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engines will penalize sites with empty pages because it makes them look like nothing new is added to the site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-make-sure-that-you-ve-got-no-orphaned-posts">4. Make sure that you’ve got no orphaned posts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way of avoiding this is by using a good sitemap generator, such as Yoast SEO, which automatically creates and updates your sitemaps for all of your different content types on WordPress.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pick-the-right-permalink-structure">Pick the right permalink structure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-use-the-permalink-structure-that-best-suits-your-site">1. Use the permalink structure that best suits your site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can use either a static (no dynamic) or a dynamic URL for all of your content, and as long as you’ve got no blank pages in any category or tag set, then this will result in search engines giving you better rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-avoid-using-wordpress-to-create-multiple-sites-from-one-template">2. Avoid using WordPress to create multiple sites from one template&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google does not recommend it because they consider this to be spammy behavior on behalf of the website owner: Some websites automatically generate new URLs when they change their domain name through something called 301 redirects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is considered spammy behavior by Google because it creates multiple sites from one template, which can give you a higher chance of getting penalized if you’re using WordPress as your content management system (CMS).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-avoid-having-duplicate-post-titles">3. Avoid having duplicate post titles</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duplicate title tags and descriptions are an indication that the site owner has been trying to artificially boost their rankings through search engine optimization techniques such as keyword stuffing – this will result in penalties for all; of your pages on the search engines!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimize-your-content">Optimize your content</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-research-what-your-users-want-and-need">1. Research what your users want and need</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your users are the people who will be visiting your website on a daily basis, so you must understand what they want and need to provide them with the best possible experience. This means that you need to conduct user research to find out what keywords and phrases your users are using when searching for information on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have identified these keywords, make sure that you include them as often as possible in your content so that your users can find what they’re looking for quickly and easily.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-write-great-content-for-your-users">2. Write great content for your users</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t expect your users to find what they are looking for on your website if you don’t provide them with great content. The search engines will penalize any site that has low-quality or duplicate content, so you must ensure that all of the pages on your website are written in a way that ensures high quality and relevant information.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content that is well written and informative will be more likely to rank in the search engines, so ensure that you are writing content that includes keywords relevant to your industry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimize-your-individual-posts-pages">Optimize your individual posts &amp; pages</h2>

<p>You should also optimize each separate page on your website so that it contains the most relevant keywords. This means that you need to ensure that all of your posts are written in a way that is engaging and informative for users and contains keywords related to what they are searching for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t do this, then search engines will not be able to determine whether or not any content on your site is useful or relevant – if there isn’t enough quality content available online about the subject matter being searched for, then people may turn elsewhere!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-set-your-focus-keyphrase-s">1. Set your focus keyphrase(s)</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-nofollow-external-links-in-wordpress">4. NoFollow external links in WordPress</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should think about when writing for WordPress not following external links. Although this may seem like a simple act, it can be one of the most important things in your blog’s overall success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people who use NoFollow will have their readers coming back time and time again because they’ll see that these posts are being shared with other websites or blogs where there could potentially be a lot more traffic than what they would get on their own. External links that you decide not to follow will also make it harder for search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing to find your blog in the first place.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-full-posts-vs-summaries-excerpts">5. Full posts vs. summaries (excerpts)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When writing for WordPress, it’s important to keep in mind that this platform allows you to write full posts or small summaries. On the one hand, people may be more likely to read your full post if they know a lot about what your blog is all about and find out something new each time they visit; however, on the other hand, readers can see an entire piece of content with just a few keywords which means that these kinds of posts can work better when you’re hoping to get traffic from search engines.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-check-broken-links-regularly">6. Check Broken Links Regularly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you write on WordPress, it’s important to know that there are going to be links in the body of your content that will make no sound. This is because most blogs have broken hyperlinks due to outdated server software or a simple mistake by their owner, and as a result, they can’t be seen by Google when someone searches for them. By checking these often, you’ll ensure that your blog posts get indexed with more frequent frequency than if they were deleted or otherwise removed by the site’s owner.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;If you’re hoping to maximize the amount of time that people spend on your blog, it’s important for you to make sure that they can easily navigate through all of its posts. When this is done to allow them to go back and forward between pages and sections, search engines will be better able to find your site when someone does a Google or Yahoo search.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Implementations of these features will also help your readers make their way around the blog’s site when they’re following along with a series of posts or reading an entire page.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re first setting up your WordPress website, it’s important to measure how fast it is loading on different devices. Doing this will allow you to make any necessary tweaks or changes to load your blog more quickly for your visitors. By doing this, you’ll also improve the overall user experience for those who visit your site. By measuring, you are able to find out what kind of problems you’re having with your site and fix them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time it takes for a web page to load is the most important factor in determining how good that user experience will be, so make sure that yours loads faster than competitors when measured by different devices.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the ways you can improve your site’s speed is by optimizing your images. By reducing the number of images on your site and using high-quality images, you will reduce the time it takes your page to load. Additionally, make sure that your HTML and CSS are free of unnecessary tags and attributes, which can also slow down a page.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, consider using a CDN (content delivery network) to ensure that your site is as fast and reliable as possible. By improving your site’s speed and minimizing the loading time for visitors, your WordPress blog posts will be more likely to convert into sales.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making regular backups is one of the most important steps to take when setting up a WordPress website. Doing this will ensure that your business’ blog will always be available for visitors no matter what happens in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before starting your blog, it’s also wise to make sure that all of those files and pages on your site are ready and loaded with the right information so there won’t be any problems down the road if something goes wrong. To ensure that everything is ready and loaded properly, you can use a plugin like BackupBuddy to make sure no errors happen when it comes time for your next backup.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-harden-your-setup">2. Harden your setup</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress setup can be a little complicated, and it takes time to learn how to use all of its features. It’s important that you spend some time learning about the various WordPress plugins, themes, and other tools available for your site before beginning any work on it. Without working knowledge of these different areas in advance, things could easily go wrong when setting up your WordPress blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turning everything off during installation is not a good idea because this will leave your site open to security threats. Instead, it would be best if you start by making sure that all of your plugins are up to date and only install new ones after verifying that none have been compromised or removed from the official plugin directory unless you have added a specific feature for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When setting up WordPress themes, it’s also important not to use any free theme templates because most will contain various kinds of malware which could lead to data being stolen during installation. If you do use a free theme, make sure to take the extra time to download it from someone reputable and not on some sketchy site filled with malware.</p>
