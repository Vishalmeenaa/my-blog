Curious to know whether or not&nbsp;<em>managed WordPress hosting</em>&nbsp;is something that you actually need? Well, I’m here to answer all your questions and help you get on the right track with WordPress hosting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are thinking of&nbsp;<a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" aria-label="Starting your own blog (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Starting your own blog</a>&nbsp;then you will absolutely need a web hosting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we’re going to&nbsp;compare&nbsp;some of the top-managed WordPress hosting companies out there.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re going to understand the&nbsp;pros and cons&nbsp;of choosing each of these managed WordPress hosting companies and by the end of this article hopefully, you will know for yourself which managed WordPress hosting is best for you and whether or not it’s actually something that you need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is Managed WordPress Hosting?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You&nbsp;all are familiar with what web hosting is and managed WordPress hosting is actually very similar to regular shared hosting except for all the technical aspects of running WordPress are actually taken care of by the hosts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now one common difference between managed hosting and shared hosting is that&nbsp;<strong><em>managed WordPress hostings</em></strong>&nbsp;usually do not have a cPanel. In other words, all the technical aspects are taken care of by the hosts and you do not actually do anything you do not get involved in any technical aspect in order to manage your WordPress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Which is the Best – Managed WordPress Hosting Vs Shared Hosting?&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are confident that you can take care of things like choosing the&nbsp;<strong>correct caching plugins</strong>&nbsp;and other things as well then you can go ahead and pick shared hosting as your host but if you do want to save more time or resources and are not getting involved on all those technical aspects of running WordPress then a WordPress hosting is better for you but if you still do want to stick to shared hosting, there are a couple of things that you should keep in mind and here they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, your website will be&nbsp;<strong>hosted</strong>&nbsp;on the same server as hundreds of other sites in these cases what happens is that any performance issue that may occur with one website will in turn affect your website as well. It’s simple as that. Just like one rotten apple may affect all in the basket.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, many shared hosting companies offer an unlimited resources plan and this is just one way to attract more users and make more money. In reality, there is no such thing as “<strong>unlimited resources</strong>” so what happens is that those shared hosting companies are going to share the resources of your WordPress website with other websites as well, and once you outgrow a certain limit they are going to basically force you to upgrade to the next time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least, there will be a lack of added value such as automatic backups and WordPress updates which ensure that your website’s data is safe and functioning securely. So why exactly managed WordPress hosting? Other areas that managed WordPress hosting is better than regular shared hosting include things like&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>speed</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>scalability</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>staging,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Comparison Between Shared WordPress Hosting and Managed WordPress Hosting!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now let’s go through each one of them and understand how exactly you can benefit from them. Believe it or not, at some point you’re going to need support with managed WordPress hosting and the faster and more responsive your support is the better for you as a customer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, with managed WordPress hostings usually, the&nbsp;<strong>support is 24/7</strong>&nbsp;and they are actually typically focused on WordPress only as a CMS and which makes them the experts of the platform which will let them help you much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>With many managed WordPress hosting providers you will get stability and consistency in the speed of your website speed is actually one of the most&nbsp;<strong>important ranking factors</strong>&nbsp;on Google and if ranking matters to you which really should then you really should optimize your website and make sure that the speed of it is as high as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Now constancy here is very important as well because you do not want your website to have many outliers or any downtime so managed WordPress hosting providers will be able to help you with this usually and it’s a huge benefit that you will receive from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another thing that many good managed WordPress hosting providers can help you with is scalability.<br><br>Say if your website is&nbsp;<strong>experiencing</strong>&nbsp;this sudden&nbsp;<a href="https://waytoidea.com/index.php/2019/06/30/how-to-increase-your-blog-traffic-easy-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth in the traffic</a>&nbsp;coming to it then it is amazing that the resources that are given to your website increase as well this is something that managed WordPress hosting providers can help you with and this way you do not actually have to change the host that you’re using in order to handle this traffic that has suddenly come to your website.&nbsp;<br><br>Staging sites is another thing that you can benefit from with managed WordPress hosting providers. What a&nbsp;staging environment&nbsp;lets you do is make changes to your website before letting it go live.&nbsp;<br><br>So, for example, if you’re having certain issues with your website you can always make a copy of your live website make changes to it make sure that everything is ok, and then push it to live.&nbsp;<br><br>So yes shared hostings are a few times&nbsp;cheaper&nbsp;than managed WordPress hosting but if you are a website owner and want to keep your hands off all the technical aspects of running your WordPress website then Managed WordPress hosting is the one for you. When it comes to managed WordPress hosting everything really depends on your needs there are no right or wrong answers as to which managed WordPress hosting is best for your website.<br><br>You may have a small website or which is a blog or a huge&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;website with a huge monthly inflow of traffic and depending on that the type of web hosting for WordPress that you need will vary now.&nbsp;<br><br>In order to understand which Managed hosting provider is actually the best one for you, we will be comparing things like price, monthly visitors, certain features that they have, and support.<br><br>So I picked some of the industry’s&nbsp;top-managed WordPress hosting providers&nbsp;and I will be comparing them for you. So instead of you going back and forth on which features you need and which not I will do the analysis for you. So let’s get started.<br><br>Before starting to write this article I created websites with each of these&nbsp;<a href="https://wpclipboard.com/best-free-wordpress-hosting-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheap WordPress hosting</a>&nbsp;providers and these are exactly Kinsta, WPengine Flywheel. And the reason why I did this is that I wanted to check and&nbsp;compare the performances&nbsp;of each of these websites and it will be another way to compare each of these managed WordPress hosting providers here are the websites. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before getting into checking their performances I would like to compare their plans and offerings as well.</p>
