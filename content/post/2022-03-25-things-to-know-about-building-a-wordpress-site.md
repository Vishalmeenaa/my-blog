<p>Building a website is something many individuals and businesses do for themselves. It can showcase what you have to offer, share your passions with the world, and do so much more. All over the internet, <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/percentage-of-wordpress-websites/#gref">hundreds of millions of websites use WordPress</a> to create their sites and ensure they look great.</p>

<p>But before you head out and <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" rel="noreferrer noopener">build your own WordPress blog</a> or site from scratch, there are some things to keep in mind. This article is going to take a closer look at a few of them.</p>

<h2>You Don’t Need to do it Yourself</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the biggest thing you need to know is that you don’t need to do it yourself. Not everyone is cut out to design an attractive and responsive site, so sometimes it is better to leave it up to the professionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are companies that specialize in <a href="https://unlimitedwp.com/">white label WordPress development</a> and can take a lot of work off of your plate. They can ensure the site looks good, works well, and many will even update it and ensure it is always performing its best. Sure, this often comes with a cost, but is well worth it for a site that works well. Sometimes, if you want a professional site built, it isn’t always the best call to do it yourself.</p>

<h2>All Aspects of Your Design are Crucial</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arguably the most important part of a website is the design. For someone to stick around and visit your site, it needs to look good and be straightforward. If a website is confusing or tough to navigate, it won’t see as many visitors as it could have.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to consider when designing your site is the theme. There are <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">thousands of themes to choose from</a>, many of which are free. The theme you choose dictates the style and color of your website, which are both incredibly important. Take time to think about the navigation, too.</p>

<p>Also, you need to ensure the site functions well, and not only looks good. If all the crazy graphics or photos you add are fun, but slow down the site loading times, it is best to get rid of them. A website is more than simply putting the information you want out into the world, you need to take time to ensure it looks good and is presented well for it to be a success in most cases.</p>

<h2>Plugins are Everything</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best things about building with WordPress is the ability to use plugins. These can add different features and functionality to your site, to improve it dramatically, without having to do any coding yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are plugins to beef up the security of your site, to ensure all images are optimized, to make sure the site is backed up, and even plugins to make it easier for visitors to reach out to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you want to figure out what kinds of plugins you want to use ahead of time. You need to make sure that the theme you choose works with your specific plugins.</p>
