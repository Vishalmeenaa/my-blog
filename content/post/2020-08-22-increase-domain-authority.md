<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, I will briefly talk about domain authority (DA), page authority (PA). And how you can increase DA PA of your website within few weeks..&nbsp;I'll tell you what it is, where it came from, how it affects traffic and how to increase it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Domain authority and page authority are concepts from the English-speaking Internet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Domain authority - DA;</li><li>Page authority - PA;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Let's get started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is Domain Authority (DA)?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Domain authority is a ranking indicator generated by Moz.&nbsp;It can be used to predict how high a site will rank in search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But don't confuse domain authority with the authority of a specific web page, as there is little difference between the two.&nbsp;The authority of a domain is shown by the ranking of its site and its subdomains.&nbsp;Page authority reflects the ranking of individual web pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the digital marketing experts at <a href="https://outreachmonks.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://outreachmonks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outreach Monks</a>, the higher your domain authority is, the more credible you are considered in the online world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is Page Authority (PA)?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like the Domain Authority (DA) gives information about the status of our entire domain i.e. the search engines of the site (eg- Google), just like the page authority i.e. PA to rank one page (post) of our website in Google. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Explains the possibility. In simple language, Page authority tells how much preference Google gives to an individual page of your site in its search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to measure DA and PA values?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many different authoritative measurement tools. The most famous one is "PageRank", which is an algorithm created by Google’s Larry Page. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It measures the quality and weight of pages based on the number, quality, and relevance of links, although Google in 2016 the measurement tool was removed from the shelves in 2009, but when you search for "PageRank" in the Google Extension Store, you can still find the relevant analysis tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another SEO authority company is "Moz". Moz has created a variety of measurement standards, including analysis tools such as MozRank and MozTrust, but unlike PageRank, it has the word "Domain Authority (DA)". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It represents the overall authority of the Internet domain name.&nbsp;Similarly, you can also find "MozRank" in the Google expansion store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Moz uses over 40 different factors to calculate Domain authority.&nbsp;The most important ones are:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>MozRank</strong> is the number of sites <strong>linking</strong> to a web page.</li><li><strong>Link Profile</strong> - This includes the internal and <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" class="rank-math-link" href="https://nikolaroza.com/are-outbound-links-good-for-seo-will-they-destroy-your-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external links of a web page.</a></li><li><strong>Root Domains</strong> - The number of unique backlinks. Let's say a page receives 100 links from a single site. Moz will treat this as 1 root domain. Therefore, it is important to get backlinks from different sites.</li><li><strong>MozTrust</strong> - Trust sites that link to a web page.</li><li><strong>Site structure and user-friendliness</strong> - To achieve a high DA, the site must be easy to crawl by search engines. And to provide a high user experience for visitors.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Domain Authority (DA): Strategy and Value</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, let's take a look at the ways to <a href="https://strategically.co/blog/think-tank/increase-website-authority/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://strategically.co/blog/think-tank/increase-website-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase website authority</a>. Although it is impossible for us to significantly increase DA in a short period of time, by operating these strategies, you can improve your position over time:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Build close internal links within the website and create high-quality relevant content.</li><li>Establish high-quality external links and pay attention to the correlation between the two.</li><li>Delete low-quality links to your website.</li><li>Not anxious + believe in accumulated power = increase in domain authority.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through these practices, your DA will slowly increase.&nbsp;Once you have a higher domain authority, all your pages containing subdomains have a chance to get a higher ranking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way to increase domain authority is focused on the skills of content and link building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has the most important core value of SEO and has a wide range of influence. Although it takes a long time, the follow-up gains are beyond imagination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Page Authority (PA): Strategy and Value</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, let's take a look at some practices that can affect the authority of the page:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Create pages on domains with higher weight.</li><li>Make sure your page content is very detailed, highly relevant and original.</li><li>Make sure your web pages are fully functional and optimized for search engines.</li><li>Build internal links between pages.</li><li>Contribute to relevant pages and get high-quality external links.</li><li>Remove poor-quality links to websites.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does it look similar to the domain weight? In fact, DA and PA increase the weight in the same way. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference is that the scale of increasing PA is smaller, and more detailed optimization is required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compared with the domain authority value, the page authority value is easier to increase. If you want to improve the ranking of a certain page, you can use the above techniques, which is simple and fast!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>DA or PA, which is more important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To put it simply, increasing DA takes longer to operate. If you keep irrigating and persevere, one day your efforts will turn into results and bring you more traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are not planning to hire an SEO expert and want to optimize by yourself, you need to consider "DA" as a long-term goal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you only focus on the ranking of a certain page, this will make you lose more traffic that has the opportunity to convert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conversely, if it only targets DA and not PA, will it cause any harm?&nbsp;Not really!&nbsp;This is a feasible long-term optimization strategy, which is very helpful for building a brand image.&nbsp;And while DA is improving, it can also help the page rank higher and easier to expose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is a good Domain authority metric?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sites like Google, Apple, or Microsoft will have a high DA (95 to 100).&nbsp;If the site is new, then its DA will be low (perhaps 10 to 20).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also need to understand that it is easier to increase the DA of a site from 20 to 30 than from 70 to 80. The general classification of ratings is something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Up to 30 - low.</li><li>From 30 to 40 - below average.</li><li>40 to 50 is medium.</li><li>50 to 60 is good.</li><li>60 to 70 - very good;</li><li>Above 80 is excellent.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Apart from this, below are some guides which can make your website loading speed super fast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Keep Your Site Structure Clean and User Friendly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>It is very important to keep the site structure clean and user friendly, so that visitors can navigate the site easily. Therefore, you have to take special care on user experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not make your site or blog more colorful. This can distract the reader's attention and may cause your blog to exit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Keep the number of links in the page in the limit</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>If you do a lot of linking in your content, then it is not a good idea. This is not good according to user experience. Also, Google also recommends adding a limit number of links to a page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Share your content on Social Sites</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>After publishing your content, do not forget to share it on social networking sites. This can easily generate a lot of traffic to your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But your content should be such that it forces the users to like share and comment. Apart from this, you can add social share button to your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Submit Guest Post to another blog</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Guest posting increases your traffic and the number of backlinks. If the number of backlinks on your site will increase then automatically your DA will increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But keep in mind one thing, the niche of the blog on which you will <a href="https://waytoidea.com/write-for-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="guest post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">guest post</a> should be related to your blog niche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>12. Let Your Domain Be Old</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The age of the domain helps a lot in increasing your site ranking and DA score. If your site is 3 or 4 years old and you publish regular quality content on it, then its Domain Authority can be 30-40 or more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if your site is 1 or 2 months old, then you do not need to think about Domain Authority right now. Just focus on content publishing now. Your DA automatic increase will continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>13. Publish Content Regularly on Your Blog</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This helps improve both the visitor and the Domain Authority on your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many bloggers who do not maintain this, due to which their DA keeps fluctuating a lot. If you publish content regularly on your blog, your DA will increase. But if not, DA may be reduced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>14. Move your site from HTTP to HTTPS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Google is using https as a ranking factor. Therefore, if you migrate your site from http to https, your Domain Authority can be greatly improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But keep in mind one thing, when you move your site from http to https and do not set proper redirection, then your website traffic can be zero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>15. Be Patient</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Domain Authority is a factor that does not increase overnight. For this you need to be patient. Just be patient and keep working, both your ranking and Domain Authority will keep improving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
