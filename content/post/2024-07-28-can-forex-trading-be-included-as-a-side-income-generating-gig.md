<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Start Small</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diving into forex trading with your life savings would be extremely risky. Begin with amounts you can afford to lose without derailing your finances. $500 or $1000 is enough to start testing the waters. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trade micro and mini lots first while you refine your strategy. Give yourself time to profit consistently in a demo account before using real capital. Think long-term sustainability over quick wins.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set a Schedule</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carve out a consistent weekly schedule for analyzing markets and planning, executing, and managing trades. Respect this schedule as you would obligations for your main job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scheduling protects your forex side hustle from being neglected. Even just 10-15 hours per week spent focused on trading activities can yield results.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leverage Advantages You Already Have</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your career industry, education, interests, or life experiences may provide insights that translate to currency trading advantages. For example, travel industry workers may have unique perspectives on global macroeconomics. Leverage your existing knowledge where possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Manage Your Risk</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using sound risk management is crucial. Employ stop losses on every position, maintain proper position sizing, and diversify across multiple currency pairs to limit exposure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By controlling risks, you can pursue profits prudently. Never trade with more capital than you can afford to lose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Automate Where Possible</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make use of automation tools like trading bots so you don't have to be physically glued to screens all day. Bots can monitor markets and execute trades per your strategy around the clock. Automation leaves you free to focus on high-value analytics and optimization, not manual trades. Work smarter, not harder.</p>
