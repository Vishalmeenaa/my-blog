<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Choose a creative and brandable domain name</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The domain name will become the identity of your website on the internet.&nbsp;Therefore, as much as possible, use a creative and&nbsp;<em>brandable name</em>&nbsp;so you can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;do&nbsp;<em>branding</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In addition, your domain will also be the name that your customers and&nbsp;<em>website</em>&nbsp;visitors are looking for, remembering and spreading&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what is meant by brandable?&nbsp;  Brandable&nbsp;domain&nbsp;names are&nbsp;<em>exceptional</em>&nbsp;names&nbsp;.&nbsp;So, not only unique and good, but your domain name must be&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>exceptional</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;If so, how do you come up with a&nbsp;<em>brandable</em>&nbsp;name&nbsp;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Create a new word.&nbsp;</strong>You can come up with a new word or term that sounds&nbsp;<em>catchy</em>&nbsp;to grab attention and should at least be easy to remember.&nbsp;"Google" and "Yahoo" are two examples.</li><li><strong>Use existing words.&nbsp;</strong>You can search for words that are rarely used in everyday life.&nbsp;It doesn't need to be exactly the same, it would be more interesting if you could "deflect" the word a little.&nbsp;For example&nbsp;&nbsp;, Gibran Rakabuming's drink&nbsp;<em>brand</em>&nbsp;called "Goola" comes from the word "sugar" which is also the main ingredient of its products.</li><li><strong>Use a domain name generator.&nbsp;</strong>Now on the internet there are many&nbsp;<em>generators</em>&nbsp;that you can use to search for domain names by simply entering the words that you think are suitable for your domain name.&nbsp;But, only use a&nbsp;<em>generator</em>&nbsp;as a source of inspiration, huh!</li></ul>

<h3>2. Make sure that your domain name is easy to type</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next tip for choosing a domain name is to ensure that your domain name is easy to type.&nbsp;Even though you have to look for a creative and&nbsp;<em>brandable</em>&nbsp;domain name&nbsp;<em>,</em>&nbsp;make sure that it's not difficult to type.&nbsp;Pay attention to the use of repeated letters such as the letter "l" in the word "&nbsp;<em>syllable</em>&nbsp;". Maybe sometimes it can make it difficult for people to type it.&nbsp;Therefore, make sure you can avoid or get around how to use repeated letters in your domain.</p>

<h3>3. Use a short domain name</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your domain name is long and hard to remember, maybe few visitors will be able to remember or recognize your domain.&nbsp;They may also have trouble spelling or have difficulty typing your domain address.&nbsp;If you use a short domain it is less likely that things like this will happen.&nbsp;When choosing a domain name, you should use no more than 17 characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Use keywords that relate to the purpose of the <em>website</em> thy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your domain is used for a&nbsp;business&nbsp;<em>website</em>&nbsp;, use&nbsp;<em>keywords</em>&nbsp;related to the business and the services you offer.&nbsp;For example, if you have a&nbsp;<em>laundry</em>&nbsp;business&nbsp;, enter the word&nbsp;<em>"laundry</em>&nbsp;" in the domain name.&nbsp;Using&nbsp;<em>keywords</em>&nbsp;in the domain can also help your&nbsp;<em>website's</em>&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;appear on the first page of search results.&nbsp;After that,&nbsp;<a href="https://waytoidea.com/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">your&nbsp;<em>website</em>&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;will also increase</a>.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dewaweb.com/blog/cara-seo-untuk-ukm-dan-bisnis-startup/" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dewaweb.com/blog/meningkatkan-traffic-website/" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dewaweb.com/blog/meningkatkan-traffic-website/" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dewaweb.com/blog/meningkatkan-traffic-website/" target="_blank"></a></p>

<h3>5. Think long term</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking for the long term are tips on choosing the next domain name. You are advised to use keywords in the domain, but you should reconsider what name you will use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One important thing you need to think about is what your main goal is to create&nbsp;this&nbsp;<em>website</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;If you are using slang terms that are only trending for a moment for your domain name, it may be difficult for people to remember your domain name sometime after that.&nbsp;Therefore, look for a domain name that&nbsp;<em>could last for a lifetime</em>&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, your domain name can also determine the reputation of your&nbsp;<em>website</em>&nbsp;on the Google search engine.&nbsp;Because, Google will search for the website identity of the domain in question.&nbsp;If you change your domain name again in the future, your reputation in Google Search will start all over again.</p>

<h3>6. Target area</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Research</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h3>9. Make sure the identity on the website is the same as social media</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h3>10. Avoid using numbers and hyphens</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As much as possible do not use numbers and&nbsp;<em>hyphens</em>&nbsp;(dashes) for domainmu name.&nbsp;Using&nbsp;<em>hyphens</em>&nbsp;can make your domain name even more complicated.&nbsp;Imagine if Facebook has a&nbsp;<em>hyphen</em>&nbsp;between "Face" and "Book" so that it becomes "Face-book", doesn't it look less effective?&nbsp;In essence, reducing the use of numbers and&nbsp;<em>hyphens</em>&nbsp;are tips for choosing a domain name that you should pay attention to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>11. Use the correct domain extension</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Domain extensions are structures of letters located at the end of domains such as .com, .org, .net, etc. To date, .com is the most popular domain extension so it might be harder for you to find a domain name that suits you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But don't&nbsp;worry,&nbsp;now there are many&nbsp;generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD)&nbsp;such as .photography, .guru, or .id.&nbsp;Maybe an extension like this can help you get a short and relevant domain name more easily.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following are some of the frequently used extensions and their functions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>.com&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- usually used for companies,&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;<em>websites</em>&nbsp;, and communities</li><li><strong>.info</strong>&nbsp;- usually used for&nbsp;informative&nbsp;<em>websites</em></li><li><strong>.net</strong>&nbsp;- usually used for&nbsp;<em>websites</em>&nbsp;that discuss or provide technical matters or internet infrastructure</li><li><strong>.org</strong>&nbsp;- usually used for&nbsp;<em>websites</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>non-</em>&nbsp;commercial and&nbsp;<em>non-profit</em>&nbsp;organizations<em></em></li><li><strong>.biz -</strong>&nbsp;usually used for&nbsp;<em>websites</em>&nbsp;of business and commercial, as the website&nbsp;<em>e-commerce</em></li><li><strong>.me</strong>&nbsp;- usually used for&nbsp;personal&nbsp;<em>websites</em>&nbsp;, blogs, or&nbsp;<em>resumes&nbsp;</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></li></ul>
