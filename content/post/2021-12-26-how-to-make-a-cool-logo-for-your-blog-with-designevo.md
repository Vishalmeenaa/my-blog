<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1. Pick a logo template</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":5330,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pick-a-logo-template-1024x610.png" alt="pick a logo template - DesignEvo" class="wp-image-5330"/></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>DesignEvo logo maker</strong> comprises a couple of web-based utilities that walk you through every step. It begins with choosing a logo design from more than 10,000, divided into different categories with different styles. This provides the ideas of the sort of logo design you're attempting to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you already have a blog logo idea in mind, you can easily start from a blank template. And make every editing according to your own design idea. Here I’d love to choose a template to start my logo creation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2. Make changes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You likewise make changes to the color, text, font, background, and more in the chosen template. You can also choose an icon or illustrations to personalize your logo. The icon library of DesignEvo boasts more than 1,000,000 icons, so you'll definitely find one that meets your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking through the accessible icons and symbols is simple. You will be given some important watchword ideas when you initially show up. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, you can straightforwardly type your keywords to find exactly what you need. The images range in intricacy, yet they're totally intended to be vector-accommodating with the goal that your final logo can be printed out at a large resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The font is also very important to a logo. So choose a font for your blog logo from the hundreds of preset ones in DesignEvo. And then adjust the color, size, position, and more by simply using the dragging and dropping options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s very flexible to adjust the spacing, opacity, outline, shadow, grow, offset, etc., of the text. What I love most in its text part is the curve feature in the tool. It offers a wide selection of classical fonts and a large list of art fonts. Just browse them and apply the desired one to your design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of DesignEvo’s shapes section, you can freely pick one, using it as an icon. Alternatively, you can choose a rectangle shape, adjust the opacity, and use it as a text background to emphasize the selected text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want a background for your blog logo, set one using a solid color or just gradient color. Do it according to your liking. There are countless possibilities, and it really depends exactly how much tweaking you want to make.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3. Preview and download</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":5327,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/preview-and-download-your-awesome-logo-1024x718.png" alt="preview and download your awesome logo - DesignEvo Logo Maker" class="wp-image-5327"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You think the logo looks great, but you are just wondering how does it look like on your blog? Don’t worry! Clicking on the preview button at the right top of the tool, you will get an overview of how will your logo look like on your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you truly like the final logo, click the download button to download it for free. But you can only get a low-resolution logo with a free download. Pick its paid logo packages to get a larger logo image or vector format.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pricing of DesignEvo Logo Packages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>If you choose the paid logo packages, you will get the high-resolution logo file for printing, and you can re-edit the logo project and re-download it unlimited times. This is great to get a satisfying logo definitely. What’s more, the Plus logo package even gives you copyright ownership and allows you to download vector files and font files. This is only $49.99.&nbsp;</p>
