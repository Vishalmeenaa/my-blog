<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Important Steps at the Beginning</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you get to the heart of learning how to make money blogging, you need to complete a few steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Choose a&nbsp;Niche</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a&nbsp;<em>niche</em>&nbsp;means that your blog will focus on a specific interest rather than a few topics. You may be wondering why this step is necessary. Whether people stumble onto your blog via a search engine or find it out of shared interest, they stay on your blog for content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So don't try and write about different things. It will only adversely affect your traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By being consistent, visitors will know what to expect and will continue to visit your site. They even tend to share your posts on their social media - which will add a boost to your traffic!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are unsure about which niche is the best fit, these tips might help:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Pick a&nbsp;<em>niche</em>&nbsp;that you enjoy writing inspiration for - you will never run out of ideas when writing about something you love.</li><li>Get to know your audience well - setting a suitable&nbsp;<em>tone</em>&nbsp;and diction will help you to appear more attractive to readers</li><li>Make sure there is a large enough market for your niche - select a&nbsp;<em>niche</em>&nbsp;that is sought after by most people so that your blog can survive in the long term</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The</em>&nbsp;right&nbsp;<em>niche</em>&nbsp;will make money from blogs faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Choose a Domain Name</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from the&nbsp;<em>niche</em>,&nbsp;the domain name&nbsp;will also determine the identity of your blog. Here's <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-choose-a-right-domain-name/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">how to choose a right domain name for your blog</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to choose a domain name is to make sure it matches your chosen niche. For example, if you create a blog about&nbsp;<em>fashion</em>, you will choose a name that describes your blog's contents as a whole, such as dailyfashion.com.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A domain name with the most searched&nbsp;<em>keywords</em>&nbsp;will also increase your blog's ranking in search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget to put in the time and effort to choose a domain name. If you are confused, you can use any available&nbsp;domain name generator&nbsp;to reference domain name ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Create a Blog</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you've established your&nbsp;<em>niche</em>&nbsp;and domain name choices, it's time to <a href="https://waytoidea.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">start a blog</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need two main things to make money blogging: web hosting and a blogging platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several types of hosting to choose from. If you are starting a blog, we recommend using our shared hosting service, as shared hosting services are the most beginner-friendly. Plus, you will get a free domain if you buy it for 12 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding what blogging platform you should use, WordPress is the best answer. WordPress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System), which is quite difficult to learn but offers a wide range of functionality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Create Interesting Content</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you understand how to</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>create a blog, and the next step is to fill it with interesting content. To keep readers feeling engaged, you need to maintain the quality and quantity of the blog posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is indeed a bit complicated. That's why we have a list of what you can do to create engaging content successfully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Look for inspiration</strong>&nbsp;- find out what kind of articles are working from your competitors' side and create better-insightful posts.</li><li><strong>Find out which format works best</strong>&nbsp;- for example, try making a post like "How to Do Something in X Minutes." Including well-structured titles and content is essential.</li><li><strong>Structure your writing properly</strong>&nbsp;- don't make grammatical mistakes, align your subtitles and paragraphs, don't write long sentences, and so on.</li><li><strong>Use fun visual aids</strong>&nbsp;- beautiful images, <a href="https://www.prodesigns.com/logo-design" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" data-schema-attribute="mentions" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">logo design</a> of your blog and videos can easily attract more readers.</li><li><strong>Always proofread</strong>&nbsp;- go over your writing or seek other help for any faults.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Engage Your Readers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it is the reader who decides whether your blog is worth visiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, there is a focus that you must pay attention to, which is to make your readers feel considered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, make them more active by adding a '&nbsp;<em>call-to-action</em>&nbsp;' to your posts. For example, invite your visitors to comment. This step will allow you to engage with blog visitors by replying to their comments - or solving any problems they have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to grab the attention of visitors is to create opinion articles. Some of your readers may disagree with your views, but that will open the door to the discussion - opening up ample audience engagement opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Getting Traffic to Your Blog</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more traffic you have, the faster you can make money blogging. There are many&nbsp;<em>bloggers</em>&nbsp;out there who have used several methods in attracting more readers. Follow this method to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://waytoidea.com/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">get more traffic</a> so you can <a href="https://waytoidea.com/ways-to-make-money-online/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">start earning money</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. SEO for Gaining Organic Traffic</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've mentioned SEO a few times before, but <a href="https://waytoidea.com/what-is-seo-search-engine-optimization" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">what exactly is SEO?</a>&nbsp;<em>Search Engine Optimization</em>&nbsp;is a practice used to get your website to appear at the top of search engine result pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://google.com/" class="rank-math-link">Google</a>&nbsp;has its algorithm that regulates which sites deserve to be at the top of the list. While no one knows how it works, <a href="https://waytoidea.com/google-ranking-factors/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">several factors can help you rank better</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Site performance</strong> - how fast your site <em>loads</em>, are your images optimized properly, etc.</li><li><strong>Quality of content</strong> - the length of your article, the length of each sentence and paragraph, etc.</li><li><strong>Keyword distribution - your keyword</strong> density, whether you are using the most searched for keywords, etc.</li><li><strong>Having</strong> a well-structured site can help <em><a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/web-crawler/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/web-crawler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crawlers</a></em> find all the information on your blog, especially if you have a <em>sitemap</em>.</li><li><strong>Links</strong> - when many relevant sites have your blog link loaded, the search engines will take this as a good sign and increase your ranking.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Paid Ads</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If organic SEO isn't giving you the traffic boost you need, why not pay for it? Using paid advertising, you can run PPC (pay-per-click) campaigns that generate large numbers of visitors to your blog!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how does it work? Well, it's similar to the commercials you see on TV, but there is a slight difference. Instead of paying upfront, you only pay when someone clicks on your ad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's better, no hurdles - find an ad service, sign up, and start advertising!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some of the popular advertising services you can choose from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ads.google.com/intl/id_id/home/"><strong>Google Ads</strong></a>&nbsp;- apart from your blog's SEO ranking, you can immediately increase your ranking on Google through this advertising program.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Facebook Paid Ads</strong></a>&nbsp;- with so many people on Facebook today, you can turn the well-known social media into your source of traffic.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ads.microsoft.com/"><strong>Bing Ads</strong></a>&nbsp;- why settle for sticking with one search engine? Make your blog appear on Bing, Yahoo !, as well as AOL!</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.blogads.com/" class="rank-math-link"><strong>BlogAds</strong>&nbsp;</a>- this advertising service allows you to target a specific target audience and show your ads on various networks (blogs and websites)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Giveaway</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know what people always say - the best things in life are free stuff! Give your audience some small gifts so they will start flocking to your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A giveaway</em>&nbsp;itself is a gift-giving in return for a quiz you give to site visitors - whether by promoting your blog, joining their e-mail newsletter, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best time for a&nbsp;<em>giveaway</em>&nbsp;is during holidays - like Christmas or Eid, for example. Use the event as your theme, pick a suitable gift, set some rules, and announce it on your social media. After that, all that's left to do is pick a winner. Easy enough, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Use&nbsp;<em>giveaway</em>&nbsp;plugins like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/giveasap/" class="rank-math-link">Simple Giveaways</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gleam/" class="rank-math-link">Gleam</a>. To make it more exciting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it will cost you to buy a gift. Consider these factors to maximize the traffic you will get from your&nbsp;<em>giveaway</em>&nbsp;:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Only provide items related to your niche</strong>.</li><li>You don't want to confuse your audience, do you? Avoid giving up game console prizes on your food blog.</li><li><strong>Value is king</strong></li><li>Make sure they are worth the effort. Cheap items will not attract a lot of enthusiasts.</li><li><strong>Don't make too many rules</strong>.</li><li>Some audiences may lose interest once they see a long list of what they need to do to get a present.</li><li><strong>Promote, promote, and keep promoting!</strong></li><li>Since your blog is new, you may not have many readers yet. You have to go a step further in announcing the contest. You can use the right hashtags, share your content info on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://woorise.com/promote-giveaway-contest-free" class="rank-math-link">forums and contest directories</a>, tell your friends to help post them, etc.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giveaway is a surefire way to get traffic at a very high speed. What's more,&nbsp;<em>giveaways</em>&nbsp;open up ways to engage more with your audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giveaway participants may just leave after your&nbsp;<em>event</em>&nbsp;is over. However, you can make sure that doesn't have to happen -&nbsp;<em>follow up</em>, create great content, engage more with visitors, etc.</p>

<h2>Legit Ways to Make Money from Your Blog</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you've got enough traffic, it's time to take on a job that can make you money!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how do you get money from blogs? Here are some of the best ways!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Google AdSense</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier, we mentioned paying for advertising to get traffic - now, the opposite. Placing ads on your blog is a great way to make money blogging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" class="rank-math-link">Google AdSense</a>&nbsp;is a PPC (&nbsp;<em>pay-per-click</em>&nbsp;) program that requires you to display ads on web pages. This is one of the most flexible methods because Google takes care of almost everything regarding advertising: which ads to show, the billing process, etc. You can also adjust the type of ad to suit your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following are the steps for placing advertisements on your blog to get money from your blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Sign up for an account with&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" class="rank-math-link">Google AdSense</a>. Fill in your information (your URL,&nbsp;<em>billing</em>&nbsp;address, etc.)</li><li><strong>Enter the verification code</strong>. Place it between the&nbsp;<em>&lt;head&gt;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>&lt;/head&gt;</em>&nbsp;of each page where you want your ad to appear. The easiest way to do this is by installing the Ad Inserter plugin. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Ad Inserter</strong>, click on the General Setting symbol, go to the Header tab, and&nbsp;<em>paste the</em>&nbsp;code there.</li><li><strong>Wait for your account to be approved</strong>. The sign-up process may be fast, but it can take up to three days for Google to verify your account.</li><li><strong>Start creating your ad</strong>. After your account is verified, you will have access to the Adsense dashboard. Go to&nbsp;<strong>My Ads &gt;&gt; New ad unit</strong>&nbsp;and customize your ad - ad name, size, and type.</li><li><strong>Copy-paste your ad code onto your blog</strong>. You can do this manually by navigating to&nbsp;<strong>Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets</strong>&nbsp;and adding Custom HTML. Place the widget anywhere and paste your code there. Alternatively, you can use the Ad Inserter plugin for that. Make sure to place your ad where your audience can see it immediately.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that the ad will appear on your blog, it's time to wait for it to get enough clicks. Sooner or later, you will reach the minimum amount (USD 100) and you will be paid at the end of the month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The process is easy</li><li>No further steps are required after setup</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Poor customization and placement can reduce your traffic</li><li>It can take a while for the new blog to receive payment</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Sponsored Content</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your blog has a lot of traffic, sponsors will want to do business with you. This is a fantastic way to make money blogging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are paid by your sponsor (e.g., company) to publish articles. What's in it for the company? These articles are designed to help companies get more customers - whether in reviews, new product announcements, sales, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who will write the articles? It depends on your agreement with your sponsor. If they want to hold you in charge of content creation, you may want to charge them more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take a look at these steps for using sponsored content to make money blogging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Create analysis reports on your blog</strong>. If you expect the company to pay you, then they will expect results. Show them how well your blog is performing - page views count, bounce rate, etc.</li><li><strong>Offer your services to local businesses</strong>. For beginners, we recommend that you build a portfolio before offering it to large companies. Alternatively, you can find potential customers on sponsor market sites such as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cooperatize.com/publishers" class="rank-math-link">Cooperatize</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://tomoson.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Tomoson</a>. Make sure to match sponsorships to your niche.</li><li>Negotiate your prices. You can use the reports to determine your costs. Based on the numbers on your skill level, the amount of effort put into perfecting your blog design, and whether or not you are responsible for content creation.</li><li><strong>Publish sponsored posts</strong>. If you are in America, the law requires you to state that you write&nbsp;<em>sponsored posts</em>. Also, make sure to match the tone and style of the article with yours.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Well,</em>&nbsp;the more you do this, the sooner you can pick up companies that are willing to pay more. Although you may want to wait before publishing another sponsored post - overdoing it can reduce your traffic. Sponsored content is one way to earn money from blogs that are quite popular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>This is a more natural advertisement than AdSense</li><li>You can gain credibility along the way</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Consecutive sponsored posts can drive your visitors away</li><li>Deciding on a price can be difficult</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Affiliate Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Affiliate marketing</em>&nbsp;is one of the most popular ways to earn money from blogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This method is very similar to&nbsp;<em>sponsored content</em>. You only need to write articles that will benefit your partner's business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there is a slight difference - instead of a negotiated fee, you get paid by the number of clicks or sales made via an affiliate link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's how to do it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Choose an affiliate program</strong>. There are many popular programs such as&nbsp;ShareASale,&nbsp;eBay Partners,&nbsp;Shopify Affiliate Program, etc.&nbsp;Plus, you can also consider Hostinger's Affiliate Program to earn a 60% commission on every sale.</li><li>Direct your readers to click&nbsp;on your&nbsp;affiliate&nbsp;link&nbsp;. A. Write a compelling review of a product or service. The more clicks you get, the more you will get. Also, make sure to be transparent - say that this is an affiliate post. Trust plays an important role in affiliate marketing.</li><li><strong>Develop your e-mail newsletter</strong>. You can reach a wider audience by personally sending content to their inbox. This is an effective solution to getting lots of clicks.</li><li><strong>Prioritize your audience</strong>. If possible, you should try the product in person. If you don't like it, your audience probably won't either. Boasting low-quality products will damage your blog's reputation.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another thing to consider is making sure the product line fits your niche to keep your brand intact. Also, there are useful plugins that can make the whole process easy, like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/thirstyaffiliates/" class="rank-math-link">ThristyAffiliates</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliatewp-affiliate-product-rates/" class="rank-math-link">AffiliateWP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A fixed price for commission</li><li>Many affiliate marketing programs are available</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Your audience isn't guaranteed to click or buy</li><li>It's hard to grow a customer base</li></ul>

<h3>5. Selling Digital Products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a knack for entrepreneurship, why not try to sell your product? This is a great way to make money blogging!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this option may take a little more effort. You have to handle many things if you choose this way - shipping, refilling, packaging, etc. However, you don't need to worry if you are selling digital products.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's more, there are many different types of digital products you can choose from - from ebooks, photography, artwork, music to&nbsp;<em>software</em>&nbsp;and even online courses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how do you sell digital products? Take a look at the steps below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Decide what to sell</strong>. Do some market research to see what sells best - and find out what price ranges. At the same time, make sure that what you are selling is your expertise or niche.</li><li><strong>Take advantage of suitable plugins</strong>. The WooCommerce plugin, already an expert in online commerce, will be just right for your needs.</li><li><strong>Start selling</strong>. Showcase your product in a compelling format like a logistical or&nbsp;<em>how-to</em>. Don't forget to write interesting writing in the product description.</li><li><strong>Follow up</strong>. Create an automatic response after every purchase to request reviews and ratings from customers.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Selling digital products is a fast and&nbsp;<em>hassle-free</em>&nbsp;way to make money blogging. However, the difficulty may be in the production of goods. If you don't know how to make something, consider selling someone else's product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several merchants are willing to give you a discount for selling their goods, and you can increase the price - according to the conditions of each&nbsp;<em>merchant</em>. However, this is not as profitable as selling your product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Usually more profitable than other methods</li><li>It can be done repeatedly</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Good quality products are hard to come by</li><li>Being a&nbsp;<em>reseller</em>&nbsp;doesn't make a lot of money</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Membership Site</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Membership sites are a pretty compelling way to get money from blogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just imagine Netflix - you have to pay every month if you want to continue watching shows from this paid streaming platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's what a membership site is! Even a few sales can generate regular income for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's more, you don't even have to worry about traffic. After the audience has paid for your services, they will visit your site regularly. Interesting right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, there are various fields you can choose from for your membership blogs, such as streaming services, software subscriptions, premium forums, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making it easy - only requires a plugin and a few setups, and you're good to go!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Install the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/s2member/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link"><strong>S2member</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;plugin</strong>.

If not, your members can cancel their&nbsp;<em>membership</em>&nbsp;at any time.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you've created a&nbsp;<em>membership</em>&nbsp;site, make sure to invest heavily in marketing. For your users, the idea of ​​having a monthly spend can be a huge commitment. You have to convince them that your services will be worth their investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Receive a monthly income for each sale</li><li>Visitors who always come will guarantee your traffic flow</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Creating fresh and premium content can be difficult</li><li>Marketing will be a challenge</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Freelance writer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After&nbsp;<em>blogging</em>&nbsp;for a while, you probably already have enough portfolio to get people to entrust you with projects.&nbsp;<em>Freelancing</em>&nbsp;is a great way to make money blogging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, there's a huge demand for freelance writers - every business needs content to maintain its&nbsp;<em>digital presence</em>. So, try to give your best writing.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freelance writing is a great option, especially when you love writing. However, a good reputation cannot be built in just one night. It may take a while for the company to notice you, and of course, it takes a lot of dedication to be successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>His job is not that different from&nbsp;<em>blogging</em></li><li>There are many ways to find a writing project</li></ul>

<h3>9. Podcast Advertising</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you feel that you are a better fit as a speaker than a writer, being a&nbsp;<em>podcast advertiser</em>&nbsp;will be a great fit for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Podcasts have several advantages over conventional writing. First, people will depend on every word they hear - without speed reading or speed reading. Second, they'll always have time to listen to podcasts, whether they're cooking, traveling, etc. That way, podcasts are a better alternative for advertising products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, what about your income? The company will pay you for every 1,000 viewers who listen to your podcast called a CPM (&nbsp;<em>cost-per-millie</em>&nbsp;).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.advertisecast.com/podcast-advertising-rates" class="rank-math-link">AdvertiseCast</a>, the average CPM for podcast ads in 2019 is $ 18 for 30-second ads and $ 25 for 60-second ads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you interested in podcast advertising? Follow the steps below for how to make money blogging with podcasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Create your podcast portfolio</strong>&nbsp;a. Create lots of compelling podcasts in advance and use them to wow your potential customers.</li><li><strong>Announce that you are offering podcast advertising</strong>. Tell the public that you have podcast ads, ask your listeners to use your services, etc.</li><li><strong>Do&nbsp;<em>cold pitching</em></strong>. If you are confident in your audience count, you can contact several companies to see if they want to advertise on your podcast.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credibility plays an important role in podcast ads - that's why you need to be top quality!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a quality podcast requires you to have excellent sound editing skills and have good quality equipment that certainly doesn't come cheap. So, if you want to make money blogging through podcasts, you need to decide whether you don't mind investing in inexpensive equipment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Podcasts are a better medium for advertising</li><li>People can listen to podcasts anywhere, anytime</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Requires technical skills</li><li>Good equipment will come at a cost</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. RSS Advertising</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RSS stands for&nbsp;<em>Really Simple Syndication</em>&nbsp;- bloggers use it to distribute their content to readers via a subscription service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you subscribe to multiple blogs, you can stay connected to their latest posts at once using the&nbsp;<em>RSS reader</em>. Sounds comfortable, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's interesting is RSS also allows you to make money from blogs through&nbsp;<em>ad placements</em>. This concept is similar to Google AdSense - you get paid for every click you make.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow the instructions below to make money via RSS advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Show an RSS button on your blog</strong>. This can help get more customers. The more of them you have, the more likely it is to get lots of clicks.</li><li><strong>Choose your ad source</strong>. You can choose to use third-party advertising programs such as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://contextualads.yahoo.net/" class="rank-math-link">Yahoo! Publisher Network</a>&nbsp;or use advertisements from your affiliate marketing program.</li><li><strong>Enter the ad code in your&nbsp;<em>feed</em></strong>. Usually, you will need to modify the core file to place your ad. That's where the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rss-footer/" class="rank-math-link">RSS Footer</a>&nbsp;plugin comes in. It has a feature where you can put HTML code in an RSS footer.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, all you need to do is keep posting, so the content and the ad will be sent to each&nbsp;<em>subscriber</em>. How? How to get money from blogs with RSS feels fun,&nbsp;<em>right?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, currently, not many people are using RSS. So, getting&nbsp;<em>subscribers</em>&nbsp;will be even more difficult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Easy to arrange</li><li>Can reach a larger audience</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deficiency</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>RSS has decreased in popularity</li><li>Getting customers takes time</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Selling Blog Content</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I rarely see Bloggers do this. But in my opinion, it is possible to do. You just need to write regular articles as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, for certain super long, super-complete articles, you can lock them using a WordPress plugin. Well, visitors who want to read the article are required to pay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe the price won't be too expensive. But if your blog visitors continue to increase, then just multiply the number. It's not difficult anyway. You only need to make an article once, and it can be sold many times, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Successful Bloggers Who Make Money</h2>
