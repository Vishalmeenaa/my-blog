<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fdfd0f">Igor Shevchenko, the head of the development department at <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" class="rank-math-link" href="https://utify.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utify,</a> told what you need to consider when preparing <a href="https://thesmallbusinessblog.net/buy-monetized-youtube-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube channel</a> for promotion, and also gave some tips for beginners. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The header (cover, background) is the first thing that YouTube users see when they visit a channel page.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, the header should show what the channel is about and what content can be found here.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be understandable and attractive to the viewer. <a aria-label="Small business can utilise video production too (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eightengines.com/video-production-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Small business can utilise video production too</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important that the cover is displayed correctly on all devices.&nbsp;Smartphone owners will not be able to see small details, so it is better to place several large images against a contrasting background.&nbsp;You can find out how it is displayed on different devices in the preview window after downloading it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not necessary to upload the entire cover at 2560 × 1440 pixels with key illustrations - only those who turn on YouTube on TV can see a picture of this size.&nbsp;It is better to place important information in the middle (within 1546 × 423) - then all users will see it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media icons should not overlap art and text if you plan to add them directly to the cover.&nbsp;When developing it, you should immediately take into account the free space in the lower right corner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To include links to social networks and the site, you need to go to the channel, click "Customize the channel view" and go to the "Basic information" tab.&nbsp;Then specify the names and the links themselves:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The avatar is not so noticeable, but it flashes in front of your eyes much more often than a hat - both in the comments, and under the videos, and in the feed.&nbsp;But due to the small size, it is difficult to come up with something special.&nbsp;It is enough to put something large and recognizable on the avatar - for example, a company logo or a photo of the author.</p>

<p>You can&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">create a profile header</a>&nbsp;in special services like&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Canva</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://crello.com/" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Crello</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;They have special templates and the ability to set unique settings - choose a size, upload your backgrounds and images.&nbsp;And an avatar can be made in <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.freelogodesign.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">FreeLogoDesign</a>&nbsp;, a service for developing logos. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The description is located on a separate tab “About the channel”, so few people get to it.&nbsp;But this text can help the channel appear more often in search results on YouTube and Google, and it can also provide contacts for advertisers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When compiling a description, it should be borne in mind that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>links will not be clickable - it is better to leave them under the videos themselves;</li><li>the maximum length is 1,000 characters: the shorter and clearer the description, the better;</li><li>2-3 keywords that reflect the topic of the channel will do the trick in the text.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Popular bloggers may not use the description at all or leave literally a couple of sentences about themselves there.&nbsp;For example, RVCJ Media, with 5.16 million subscribers, has only four lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Popular search queries (keywords) for channel descriptions will help you find services like&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://wordstat.yandex.com" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Yandex.Wordstat</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=IN" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Google Trends</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;There are also specialized ones, for example,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">Keyword Tool</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=ru" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">VidIQ</a>&nbsp;- a free plugin for Google Chrome.</p>

<p>The easier it is to navigate through the videos on a channel, the more likely a casual viewer will find something interesting and decide to subscribe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You shouldn't wait for hundreds of videos: even if you have 10-15 of them so far, you need to think over the navigation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, with the help of playlists, which can be used as a rubricator - to divide videos by certain topics, separate directions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bonus will be additional views (due to the fact that the videos are automatically played in turn), as well as the ability to get into the search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use the home page for navigation.&nbsp;By default, three sections are shown there: the last uploaded videos, all playlists, open subscriptions to other channels.&nbsp;But you can add more sections (up to 10).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, this way you can select each playlist in a separate section.&nbsp;Then viewers will see not only the playlist itself, but also the names of the videos in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget about the navigation tools in the videos themselves.</p>

<p>Trailer - a welcome video on the main page of the channel.&nbsp;It will be seen by everyone who has not yet signed up.&nbsp;For PC and TV users, it will play automatically as soon as they go to the channel page.&nbsp;Smartphone and tablet users will simply see it on the first screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1775,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://waytoidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slomo-guys-YouTube-channel-trailer-1024x667.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1775" title=""/><figcaption>This is what the trailer looks like.&nbsp;It starts automatically, you can see part of the description on the main page - it can cause additional interest in the content</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The purpose of the trailer, like the covers, is to show what content is waiting for the viewer, why the channel will be interesting and why subscribe to it.&nbsp;As a rule, such a video is dynamic and short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a&nbsp;study by&nbsp;Wistia, a significant drop in engagement can be seen after just two minutes of the video.&nbsp;Ideally, if the trailer will be within 1.5-2 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the trailer, you can:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>make a cut of the most interesting moments from previous videos;</li><li>tell the camera what you are filming about and why you should subscribe;</li><li>mention some significant achievements like the golden YouTube button.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you don't have to bother, but just use one of the already uploaded videos as a trailer - for example, the most viewed or, conversely, the one with the least views.&nbsp;The main thing is that the content is interesting to potential subscribers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are recording a video separately, first upload it to the channel as a regular video, and then add it to the main page in the settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, you can immediately add a video for those who are already subscribed.&nbsp;You need to choose the published video in the same way or record it separately (for example, to announce some interesting direction).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then add the video to the main page - through the "Recommended video for subscribers" in the settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optimization is a good opportunity to show your content to the right audience.&nbsp;This is important to get more traffic for the same investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research from backlinko and Briggsby&nbsp;shows that there is a direct link between optimization, audience engagement, and rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several ways to optimize videos on a YouTube channel (most will work for published videos as well):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Create an interesting, clickable title that will make you want to watch the video.&nbsp;It is desirable that it also contains a relevant keyword.</li><li>Write detailed descriptions.&nbsp;YouTube takes them into account when determining the subject of videos and looking for an audience.&nbsp;Therefore, it will not be superfluous to tell in detail what will be discussed, using 2-3 keys.</li><li>Add suitable tags.&nbsp;These are themed words that people can use to find your videos.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to add only those keywords and tags that are truly relevant to the topic and content of the video.&nbsp;Otherwise, the video and channel may be poorly promoted, shown to the wrong audience.</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Pay attention to the preview.&nbsp;An interesting picture increases click-through rate (CTR), which is one of the ranking factors.</li><li>Make the beginning of your video as interesting as possible.&nbsp;People are more likely to leave in the first minutes, and this has a negative impact on the viewing time.</li><li>Call for activity.&nbsp;Viewers will like and comment more if asked or asked open-ended questions.</li><li>Make navigation easy.&nbsp;Add timecodes to your videos so people jump straight to the interesting moments rather than leaving the channel.&nbsp;Use hints and end screensavers - this way some of the viewers will not leave without a subscription, but will go to watch your next video.</li></ul>
