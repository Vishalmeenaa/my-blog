<h2>Why are Power Words Useful in Marketing?&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of the article, powerful words have a magic of their own. They are capable of arousing emotions in all people from one moment to another, whether they are positive or negative, depending on the context and tone in which they are said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We present a long list of powerful words that are capable of awakening different emotions in those who receive them; However, are you interested in knowing how mastering these types of words can make your business improve a lot?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/14-trigger-words-to-ignite-engagement-with-your-blog-posts/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Patel</a>, “<em>the right words will always motivate, push and/or guide people to take the right action and increase content engagement</em>&nbsp;“. For these powerful words to be useful in a marketing strategy, the main thing is to identify the type of business you have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, imagine that you are dedicated to the sale of technological products. What you are looking for likely is to highlight the quality and usefulness of your products. On the other hand, if you sell youth clothing, you may be looking to convey personality and freshness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, some more digital marketing experts explain that including words related to emotions in your email marketing campaign will generate greater proximity to your audience. This is also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotion-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emotional marketing</a>. However, if you convey the wrong emotions, your customers are likely to experience rejection or disappointment instead of being attracted to your business. So be careful with that!</p>
