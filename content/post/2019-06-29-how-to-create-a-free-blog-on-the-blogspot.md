<h3>Disadvantages of Blogger</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blogger belongs to Google, one of the most important technology companies in the world. However, creating a blog on Blogger not only has a positive side full of advantages, but it also has its drawbacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, we will comment on some of the points that you should take into account before deciding if you want to create a blog on Blogger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Difficulties for SEO optimization</strong>: The SEO optimization of your content on Blogger can be somewhat limited, especially when it comes to the URL of your blog. With Blogger you do not have the option to customize the URL of your content based on your needs or a particular keyword. In addition, Blogger URLs often include the publication date of the content, so users may consider this information to be out of date.</li><li><strong>Few Customization Options</strong>: Although any Blogger blog can be customized, the options are quite limited. Unlike other PAID platforms where you can create a blog, in Blogger you cannot add plugins that help you customize each of the aspects of your preference in detail. You can only customize a Blogger blog with some templates from the platform, or with the HTML code of Blogger templates of some pages. However, external templates often slow down the <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/speed-up-wordpress-website/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/speed-up-wordpress-website/" rel="noreferrer noopener">loading speed of the blog</a> and affect the user experience.</li><li><strong>Appearance is Unprofessional</strong>: Blogger is one of the best options to create a free blog, especially if you want to have a personal blog to share personal experiences or opinions, among other things. However, if you want to go into content marketing or earn money from ads with what you write, creating a blog with Blogger might not be the best option.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blogger's look and feel are unprofessional, and even though according to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/187276/bloggercom-monthly-visits/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statista report</a>, blogs hosted on Blogger domains received more than 53 million visits in the first half of 2021, some options could give you better results.</p>
