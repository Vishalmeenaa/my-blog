<h2>What is a Backlink?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But so that you don't have to leave this page, we will give a brief overview of what a backlink is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A backlink is formed when one website mentions another website on its site, which is through a link. This is the process of making a connection via an external website. These connections help drive traffic to your site and&nbsp;<a href="https://waytoidea.com/increase-domain-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the authority of your site.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, let's say Company A writes a blog post about how to get a credit card. Company B, a leading credit card company, linked to the article on their website. For Company A, this link is a backlink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Backlinks are also known as incoming links or inbound/incoming links. To understand more about the backlink concept and how it works, read on; What is a Hyperlink?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note</strong>:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you want a backlink to add value to your site, it must be a natural link. There are opportunities out there that will allow you to pay for links to your website, but if you do, you run the risk of reducing your ranking or being blocked by Google.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not okay. But it is risky and must be done professionally and carefully not to be considered SPAM or in the black hat SEO category.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In essence, it's better to have a few high-quality backlinks than lots of low-quality links. High-quality backlinks will drive better results for your business and help you rank search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Types of Backlinks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google determines whether a website's backlink is relevant to a related topic by looking at the type of backlink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two types of backlinks that determine the quality of your backlinks, namely:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>DoFollow Backlinks</strong>: This type of backlink is the dream of all website owners because these backlinks send signals to Google to index the destination link. So that the intended website is more "visible" and Of your website can increase its ranking.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Nofollow Backlinks</strong>: A no-follow backlink is an attribute in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niagahoster.co.id/blog/belajar-html/?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTML&nbsp;</a><em>rel = no-follow</em>&nbsp;that provides code to search engines not to follow the painted link.&nbsp; Usually, no-follow backlinks are used when you don't want to give backlinks for free and avoid backlink spam.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Backlinks are essential for a blog or website. because they determine the site pages' authority, you must have a high authority domain to appear in more relevant search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you get a backlink, it serves as a symbol that other websites are supporting your content. If Google sees that some high authority sites link back to your page, it will assume that you have relevant content that is worthy of linking to other websites. </p>
