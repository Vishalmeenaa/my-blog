<h2>What is Digital Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of you may have searched and found the meaning of digital marketing provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" data-schema-attribute="about" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is nothing wrong with this understanding. Some people will be delighted with this understanding. But&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/what-is-digital-marketing/" class="rank-math-link">Dave Chaffey</a>&nbsp;from smartinsights.com offers a broader definition of digital marketing, namely:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Dave Chaffey explained that digital marketing includes managing various forms of your presence digitally, such as company websites, smartphone applications, and company pages on social media and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Digital Marketing Strategy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing includes techniques used such as search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), social media optimization (<a href="https://blog.alexa.com/social-media-optimization/" target="_blank" aria-label="SMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">SMO</a>), social media marketing (<a aria-label="SMM (opens in a new tab)" href="https://neilpatel.com/what-is-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">SMM</a>), various types of online advertising, e-mail marketing, and partnership arrangements with other websites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These techniques are used to acquire new customers and provide services to existing customers. Don't worry, and we will gradually and slowly discuss all of these terms so that they are easy to understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing also includes developing customer relationships through E-CRM and marketing automation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, for digital marketing to be successful, there is still a need to integrate these techniques with traditional media such as print, TV, and direct mail as part of multichannel marketing communications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many types. Here are some of them</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, it was explained that digital marketing tools that can be used and are among the easiest and cheapest are social media. Who is the person who doesn't have a social media account these days?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From children to the elderly, they have at least 1 type of social media, and this is the right "shop" to sell because it reaches all people and is easily accessible to anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can use social media that is well known and widely used by people in various countries to do digital marketing. These social media include Facebook (FB), the largest and most commonly used platform globally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use Instagram (IG), where people will find it easier to see it through the hashtag (#) you use for the products you sell. Twitter is also the media of choice for many business people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides being able to increase sales, social media can also increase customer loyalty. This is evident from the data&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30239/71-more-likely-to-purchase-based-on-social-media-referrals-infographic.aspx" class="rank-math-link">hubspot.com</a>&nbsp;b the&nbsp;<strong>71% of consumers</strong>&nbsp;who had good social media services and are likely to&nbsp;<strong>recommend it to others</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You must also have often heard the term SEO along with this internet era. SEO stands for&nbsp;<em>Search Engine Optimization</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you know that according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/" class="rank-math-link">internet live stats&nbsp;</a>sources<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">,</a>&nbsp;there are more than&nbsp;<strong>4 billion&nbsp;</strong>Google searches performed every day?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.brightlocal.com/resources/9-essential-stats-convincing-smbs-invest-local-search/" class="rank-math-link">bright local</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>98% of&nbsp;</strong>searchers will choose a business that is on&nbsp;<strong>the first page of a search engine</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Learn more about search engine optimization and its ins and outs in the following article</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engine marketing is also known as paid search. <a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/what-is-sem/" target="_blank" aria-label="SEM (opens in a new tab)" data-schema-attribute="about" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">SEM</a> is the practice of marketing a business using paid advertisements that appear on search engine result pages (or SERPs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This type of advertising has many advantages. In addition to better targeting, it also applies a&nbsp;<em>Pay per Click</em>&nbsp;system&nbsp;<em>in terms of costs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the world of digital marketing, it is also known as&nbsp;<em>Pay per Click</em>&nbsp;or PPC, which is a method that calculates advertising costs according to the number of clicks you get on the advertisements installed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPC makes our advertising costs very affordable. We can appear on the first page of Google according to the keywords we want without bothering. The cost is relatively light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>E-mail Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nowadays, almost all forms of correspondence and communication are done via electronic mail or better known as e-mail or e-mail.&nbsp;<em>Electronic mail</em>&nbsp;or electronic mail can also be used as a means of doing digital marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be one of those who often get e-mails containing promos from brands or brands that offer their products. That is what is called digital marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, the e-mail comes from an account or website that you have followed or subscribed to before. Or products where you are registered as a member. Examples of products that commonly use e-mail as a means of digital marketing include fast-food restaurants or leading online stores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should know that the average <a href="https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/marketing-roi" target="_blank" aria-label="ROI (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">ROI</a> from e-mail marketing is&nbsp;<strong>3800%</strong>. Yes, you read that right,&nbsp;<strong>3800%</strong>. This means that for every $1000 marketing investment in e-mail marketing, you will get an ROI of $38,000. This is in accordance with the release delivered by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.emailmonday.com/dma-national-client-email-report-2015/" class="rank-math-link">emailmonday.com</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This method is also quite effective because people are usually required to write down their e-mail addresses when they fill out the&nbsp;<em>member card</em>&nbsp;form and the like. In this age of Android, everyone has e-mail and uses it a lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Content Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also do marketing by creating digital content such as blogs or videos. When talking about digital blogs or videos, it cannot be separated from the SEO issues previously discussed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The content on the blog or video that you create can be found and seen by many people, making it that has high SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can create your own content to fill your blog or use existing SEO writing services. Creating content or content for attractive blogs and can appear at the top of the search results will help open up opportunities for the product or service you offer to be seen and attract people's attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, according to research that has been conducted, the results show that those who live in the United States watch or view at least one video per month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the frequency will be much higher among young people. That way, advertising on video channels is also a fairly effective digital marketing method. Another form is Videotron as a tool to advertise a product or service.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Position or Role in Digital Marketing</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though the business is conducted online, there are still specific roles or "positions" whose purpose is that all tasks can be carried out in a planned manner to be better. Some of the positions or roles commonly held by digital marketers include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, indeed, being able to do digital marketing or become a reliable digital marketer requires process and time.&nbsp;<em>Learning by doing</em>,&nbsp;<em>practice makes perfect</em>, so the terms that might be used. It must be done gradually while learning so that you will find out how digital marketing is effective and profitable for your business over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then will this digital marketing strategy be effective and successful in all types of businesses or businesses? Actually, everything returns to the way it is applied because each of them has a different character. For more details, see the explanation below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Types of Businesses Using Digital Marketing Strategies</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Business to Business (B2B)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Types of businesses that use the B2B or business to business model, digital marketing, or online marketing strategies are focused on efforts to collect consumer data (lead generation).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, because the goal is to map potential customers, an attractive marketing strategy is needed to bring in potential customers for your business. Applying a digital marketing system for this type of B2B business can also be made using business-specific social media such as Linkedin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is that what is meant by this type of B2B business? Namely business activities carried out by 2 parties who are both business actors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transactions carried out are electronically in the form of exchanging business documents between companies using an application via a computer with the&nbsp;<em>Electronic Data Interchange</em>&nbsp;(EDI) format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Business to Customer (B2C)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept of digital marketing will have a different strategy and application if your business model is business to consumer or business to customer (B2C). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The striking difference between B2B and B2C types of businesses is their purpose. If B2B focuses on consumer data collection (lead generation), then B2C is not 100% focused on this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This type of B2C business focuses more on making an attractive journey for potential buyers or consumers (&nbsp;<em>customer journeys</em>&nbsp;) who have visited the web, blog, social media, and other company-owned online marketing media. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It kind of gives off a pleasant impression from the moment consumers enter the web until they make a purchase transaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this type of B2C business, you don't need an intermediary or salesperson to sell products to buyers or consumers. All you need is interesting digital marketing content and then make a&nbsp;<em>call to action</em>&nbsp;(CTA) or an invitation to buy or use your product to potential consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, this business is a type of business where consumers interact directly with consumers using electronic media. An example of common digital media that can be used is Instagram (IG).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Orders or purchases by consumers to buyers in this B2C business model are carried out directly. Usually, the sellers or business actors have provided or stated the price of the goods or services being sold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, transactions are carried out using electronic cash methods or electronic payments such as bank transfers. You can also use a secure payment system method such as a gateway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last is how to create good content to do effective digital marketing and bring many consumers to your business. It is undeniable that content is the "soul" for the digital marketing that you do. People will not be interested in content that they think is just "junk."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What To Consider In Creating Content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Do a Mapping</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The objectives of this mapping are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Understand the characteristics of potential customers to find out which marketing methods are suitable for use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Estimating how potential people are to buy or see potential customers' position on the customer journey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create Appropriate Content Types</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After doing the mapping, it's time to determine and create the type of digital marketing content that suits potential consumers' character and segment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start by creating a profile on the target or consumer segment that you want to reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can be done only by using a free template, so there is no cost. After that, find out what your customers want. That way, consumers will be happy and interested in your digital promos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is our discussion about what digital marketing is and its ins and outs. I hope it is useful.</p>
