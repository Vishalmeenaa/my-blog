<h2>Know All About Dedicated Server</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name depicts, a dedicated server is a server that is dedicated entirely to the single hosting account user. Unlike other hosting servers, it contains enterprise-grade hardware resources that maximize the performance of mission-critical applications. Due to this, there is minimal latency and higher uptime of web projects and files hosted on dedicated servers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no sharing of resources CPU, RAM, and disk space in dedicated hosting servers with other hosting account users or noisy neighbours. Web hosting providers also use other phrases like bare metal servers or unmanaged dedicated servers. It is because users' web files and databases are enclosed in physical hardware. Hypervisors' duty is to abstract the physical hardware hence named bare metal server.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the help of dedicated hosting servers, organizations or website owners meet high performance and task speeds of websites and applications. Also, they gain full root control over servers. With no cap on server resources, users have the freedom to use dedicated servers to host as much applications or websites they want. Mainly, such servers help host resource-heavy web projects with no performance issues.</p>

<h2>When to Opt for Dedicated Servers?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h3>1. Looking for A Better Performance of Websites/Applications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be no extended downtime or hosting-related issues with more storage space, latest generation processors, and maximum CPU cores. Only the point you need to consider is to make the smart choice by choosing a reliable web hosting provider.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Enhanced Security Level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike other hosting plans like shared, cloud, and others, there is always a chance of a security loophole. It is only because server resources are shared among different users. So, there is always a chance of data loss, intrusion activities, and <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/protect-your-site-from-brute-force-attacks/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/protect-your-site-from-brute-force-attacks/" rel="noreferrer noopener">malware attacks</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hence, with dedicated servers' users get an additional level of security by SFTP, SSL, and full root SSH access. Moreover, no outside hosting user can intrude on dedicated hosting servers or try to hack them. That is why enterprises worldwide host websites and applications on dedicated servers only to secure their database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Good Hosting Infrastructure&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why use different servers to host different size applications? Try dedicated servers if you have emails, VPN applications, websites, and others to host. With maximum storage space and higher bandwidth, and fast SSDs, such hosting servers can host volumes of mission-critical web projects without any performance issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, investing in different hosting servers, it is better to pay for one server and enjoy the optimal hosting infrastructure of others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Reliability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many website owners face challenges in terms of performance and technical issues while getting massive traffic on their websites. As a result, server crashes or users face technical errors while accessing websites. To eradicate this problem, choose dedicated servers because they have reliable hosting resources to manage <a href="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.waytoidea.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic/" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-volume traffic</a> on websites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether we are talking about cost margins or the type of server you want to host, there are many types of dedicated servers, so choosing one that will suit your needs can be overwhelming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How Many Types of Dedicated Servers Are Available?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mostly, there are only two types of dedicated servers that are used widely by website hosting users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Managed Dedicated Servers&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name suggests, this type of dedicated server is configured by the web hosting provider, and its maintenance and all other technical aspects are also managed by the same. The web hosting provider looks at several responsibilities like operating system and control panel issues or hardware setup.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Data migration, backup and security patches are all that look after the web hosting service provider only. They also manage the standard functionality of the server and resolve technical glitches if they occur. Managed dedicated hosting servers are available at additional costs. However, pick the right web hosting partner so that there is no compromise on quality standards while hosting websites and applications.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Unmanaged Dedicated Servers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike managed dedicated web hosting servers, data security and configuration management are managed by the hosting account user only. Remember that every server comes up with a certain configuration, operating systems, control panels and other related hosting infrastructure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if users have a sample amount of technical expertise, they can easily prefer unmanaged dedicated hosting plans. One good point is that unmanaged dedicated servers are comparatively less in cost because users are only paying for the hosting infrastructure and not for using the human resources and expertise of the web hosting provider. Therefore, many web hosting providers offer unmanaged dedicated hosting plans by default.&nbsp;</p>
